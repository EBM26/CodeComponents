			<h2><i><u>Sign Overview</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries is the Cardinal stage of the Fire element and is ruled by the lunar side of Mars. This means that he uses Mars' pure and powerful energy to begin (Cardinal) his own actions and self-expressions (Fire element). It is the strong, pure, and concentrated energy of Mars that make Aries so fast-paced, impulsive, highly sexual, and have an abundant amount of energy to do the things he is concentrating on. The Cardinal stage is what makes him like to start and spearhead new actions or relationships, be extremely stubborn, hate to lose/quit, be spontaneous, and be independent. The Fire element is what makes Aries warm-hearted, proud, active, passionate, enthusiastic, quick-tempered yet quick to calm down, always cheerful, and rarely sad/depressed.</p>

			<h2><i><u>How to Spot an Aries</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries usually has a taller than average height; rarely short. He is well balanced at both upper and lower body sections so that if his shoulders are big, so are his legs. His face is made of short, straight, clear-cut, distinctive lines. He usually has strong eyebrows. His most distinctive features are that his body is always upright, never slouching, and that his upper body and head are always leaning forward, as if rushing somewhere.  His movements are fast and sharp, and so are his wits. He is very talkative and usually talks about his most important, favorite subject; himself. Sometimes, there are Aries that are more of a quite, gentle lamb than a loud, aggressive ram. But don't mistake that quietness to be reservedness, Aries holds back from nothing.</p>

			<h2><i><u>Potential Strengths vs. Potential Weaknesses</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries' strong traits are: wonder, innocence, blind faith, bravery, energetic, diligence, and enthusiasm. These strengths can potentially turn into weaknesses and become: selfishness, inconsideration, over-aggressiveness, hasty actions provoked by urges without calculating the consequences, and stubbornness. Aries is highly optimistic, believes in miracles, and beating the odds even if they are totally against him. He stays devoted to his goal and does not give up easily at all. He is very athletic and is usually in good or great shape. He is very innocent and finds it extremely difficult to lie or trick someone. He is known for his fast temper and "shoot first, ask questions later" attitude. </p>
				</div>
			</div><br>
			<div class="info-box">
			<h2><i><u>Pitfalls vs. Good Paths in Life</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Since Aries is like an innocent baby, he ignores the possibility that he might suffer from accidents, pains, or cruelty. Along the way in life, when things like that eventually happen, Aries adopts an unnatural toughness, suspiciousness, and survival skills to make sure he is protected from harm. This may make him a bit bitter in life or untrusting of other people. He then needs to learn that the world is not a cruel place and that he can carefully trust others. Aries is also known for his hot temper, rash and manner-less behavior. This can lead to him angering people around him and making enemies hastily. Of course, as a Fire sign, his anger quiets quickly and he forgets the harm he has done to others. He needs to learn to be patient with other people and give a bit of thought before making important moves. The last pitfall has to do with Aries' self-centeredness. He instinctually expects devoted love from others and does not know how to give the same level of devoted love back. This might result in his friends/mates being upset at his lack of reciprocity. He should learn how to look beyond himself a bit and give back the same level of intense love he expects.</p>

			<h2><i><u>Likes/Hobbies</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries enjoys being active and showing off his superiority to all. Therefore, Aries loves sports, especially the kinds that are more individual rather than team sports, such as running or jumping. He also likes the martial since he is so aware of his body and his movement. His natural aggressiveness finds self-expression within the martial arts. He loves fast cars. His favorite color is red (like the color of his planet, Mars) and it makes him feel good whenever he wears it. He eats a lot because he burns so much energy but is not necessarily a foodie.  He loves red meat. He likes to wear clothes that don't restrict his fast pace movements.</p>

			<h2><i><u>Dislikes/Pet Peeves</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries dislikes authority since he believes he should always be the leader in every matter. He hates being criticized or told what to do. He hates sitting idly and not being active. He dislikes not being first priority in midst of other people. He doesn't like being tied down by details or manners and wants to be free to charge forward and do what he wants. He really hates people who are deceptive and try to take advantage of his innocence. He also hates lingering in the past; Aries is all about moving forward. People who complain a lot or feel sorry for themselves is another pet peeve of his. </p>

			<h2><i><u>How to Approach an Aires</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>There usually will not be a need for you to approach an Aries on your own as he will take the initiative and introduce himself with a friendly, energetic smile accompanied with a strong handshake. The most important concept to grasp when dealing with an Aries is that he is concentrated purely on himself. That is NOT to say that he is selfish. On the contrary, Aries is a very warm, generous, and helpful person. Aries is concentrated on expressing himself to the world and others.  Aries wants to feel himself being loved, touched, care for, succeed, etc. He believes everyone feels that way and cannot imagine a different way for people to feel. Therefore, Aries might come across as a person who will not reciprocate feelings and good actions in relationships. This is not true; he is just too concentrated on how he feels by others actions and forgets everyone else. Aries wants to be the leading force in any endeavor and you will do wisely if you allow him to do that. Arguing with an Aries is also a lost cause; once he is set on a way/opinion, he is the only one that can change it. Aries moves from one idea/action to the next with the intense energy of Mars so you need to be fast enough to catch up; Aries slows down for no one. At times, Aries' famous temper will flare up and he might even ram head first into you if you upset him. This flash of anger will fade soon and Aries will not even remember the ordeal so you best pretend it didn't occur either. Aires is very verbally expressive of himself and will often say things out loud or to people's faces that might upset them. Remember, he means no harm at all. Aries is innocent and gullible and is sometimes lied to or cheated by those who recognize that in him. Rest assured, if and when he finds out, that will be their first and last affair with him. Aires loves receiving gifts.</p>

			<h2><i><u>Relationship Aspirations</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries looks for a mate from the fairy tales: beautiful, intelligent, always well-groomed, always smiling, sophisticated, and well-behaved. The female Aries despises a man that drools over her or is willing to be her slave. She likes a strong man who knows how to play hard to get. Once Aries is convinced he is in love, he will go at that person with the full force of the energy that Mars provides him. It is a burst of emotional energy and love that other signs are not used to experiencing.  Aries is a very jealous mate, both male and female, so his mate needs to know not to flirt with anyone. On the flipside, Aries hates having his freedom restricted by anyone and will sometime flirt with the opposite sex. No need to worry, once Aries is set on a mate, it is very rare that he will cheat on her/him, especially since he loathes dishonesty. Aries loves cleanliness and his mates need to be well groomed and clean around him. Aries wants someone who is dynamic, energetic, and fun to be around. He especially is attracted to people who are mysterious, the ones who show much complexity and sophistication without anyone knowing how they do it. Most importantly, Aries wants someone who will be a part of the most important thing in his life; himself. Someone who will help Aries experience himself through life's adventures. </p>

			<h2><i><u>Key Words</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>

			<div class="info-box">
			<h2><i><u>Modus Operandi</u></i> <div class="triangle-right inline-block"></div></h2>
			<div class="info-p">
				<p>Aries uses his powerful energy to go forward full force at achieving his goals. He is not preoccupied with security or the future because he is certain that he can handle anything that will arise in the future and therefore concentrates on the now. Aries does not do things in order to gain fame or respect; after all, those concepts exist through the minds of others and Aries is not preoccupied about other people, let alone their opinions of him. When faced with a challenge in front of his goal, Aries will use his force to ram through it with an impulsive manner. If that fails, he will try again with even more force until he either breaks through the blockade or gets severely injured trying.  </p>
