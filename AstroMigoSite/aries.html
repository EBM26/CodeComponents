				<h2><img src="images/summary.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Sign Overview</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">A</span>ries is the Cardinal stage of the Fire element and is ruled by the lunar side of Mars. This means that they use Mars' pure and powerful energy to begin (Cardinal) their own actions and self-expressions (Fire element). It is the strong, pure, and concentrated energy of Mars that makes Aries so fast-paced, impulsive, highly sexual, and have an abundant amount of energy to do the things they are concentrating on.</p>
					<p>The Cardinal stage is what makes them like to start and spearhead new actions or relationships, be extremely stubborn, hate to lose/quit, be spontaneous, and be independent. The Fire element is what makes Aries warm-hearted, proud, active, passionate, enthusiastic, quick-tempered yet quick to calm down, always cheerful, and rarely sad/depressed.</p>

				<h2><img src="images/aries-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Symbol Meaning</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries symbol is a ram. This is represented in Aries by them taking matters head on with their horns forward, being very athletic, being beast-like, intuitive, sensual, and always jumping around from one place to the next.</p>
				</div>

				<h2><img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Karmic Stage</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries represents the "New Born" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. After going through the formless, abstract stage of Pisces, the soul has one purpose in life: to lead the formation of new, concrete actions. Aries, like a new-born, are solely concentrated on their own existence and being. They are very aware of their bodies and shout out and express themselves loudly when they feel they are being neglected in any way. They are very self-oriented just like a new-born and have the innocence and child-like manner of one.</p>
				    <p>Aries often believes in fairy tales, miracles, and lucky charms etc. Their life mantra is "I exist". They came to teach that "love is innocence" and to learn that "love is trust", since Aries innocence leads them to be taken advantage of and hurt by others. </p>

				<h2><img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>How to Spot an Aries</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries usually have a taller than average height; rarely short. They are well balanced at both upper and lower body sections so that if their shoulders are big, so are their legs. Their face is made of short, straight, clear-cut, distinctive lines. They usually have strong eyebrows. Their most distinctive features are that their bodies are always upright, never slouching, and that their upper bodies and heads are always leaning forward, as if rushing somewhere.</p> 
					<p>Aries movements are fast and sharp, and so are their wits. They are very talkative and usually talk about their most important, favorite subject; themselves. Sometimes, there are Aries that are more of a quite, gentle lamb than a loud, aggressive ram. But don't mistake that quietness to be reservedness, Aries hold back from nothing.</p>

				<h2><img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Potential Strengths vs. Potential Weaknesses</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries strong traits are: wonder, innocence, blind faith, bravery, energetic, diligence, and enthusiasm. These strengths can potentially turn into weaknesses and become: selfishness, inconsideration, over-aggressiveness, hasty actions provoked by urges without calculating the consequences, and stubbornness.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Aries are highly optimistic, believe in miracles, and beating the odds even if they are totally against them. They stay devoted to their goal and do not give up easily at all.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Aries are highly optimistic, believe in miracles, and beating the odds even if they are totally against them. They stay devoted to their goal and do not give up easily at all. They are very athletic and are usually in good or great shape. They are very innocent and find it extremely difficult to lie or trick someone. They are known for their fast temper and "shoot first, ask questions later" attitude. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="info-box">
				<h2><img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Since Aries are like innocent babies, they ignore the possibility that they might suffer from accidents, pains, or cruelty. Along the way in life, when things like that eventually happen, Aries adopt an unnatural toughness, suspiciousness, and survival skills to make sure they are protected from harm. This may make them a bit bitter in life or untrusting of other people. It would be wise for them to learn that the world is not a cruel place and that they can carefully trust others.</p>
					<p>Aries are also known for their hot temper, rash and manner-less behavior. This can lead to them angering people around them and making enemies hastily. Of course, as a Fire sign, their anger quiets quickly and they forget the harm they have done to others. It would be wise for them to learn to be patient with other people and give a bit of thought before making important moves.</p> 
					<p>The last pitfall has to do with Aries self-centeredness. They instinctively expect devoted love from others and do not know how to give the same level of devoted love back. This might result in their friends/mates being upset at their lack of reciprocity. They should learn how to look beyond themselves a bit and give back the same level of intense love they expect.</p>

				<h2><img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Likes / Hobbies</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries enjoy being active and showing off their superiority to all. Therefore, Aries love sports, especially the kinds that are more individual rather than team sports, such as running or jumping. They also like the martial since they are so aware of their bodies and movements. Their natural aggressiveness finds self-expression within the martial arts. They love fast cars.</p>

					<p>Aries favorite color is red (like the color of their planet, Mars) and it makes them feel good whenever they wear it. They eat a lot because they burn so much energy but aren't necessarily considered a foodie.  They love red meat. Aries like to wear clothes that don't restrict their fast pace movements.</p>

				<h2><img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries dislikes authority since they believe they should always be the leader in every matter. They hate being criticized or told what to do. They hate sitting idly and not being active. They dislike not being first priority in midst of other people. Aries don't like being tied down by details or manners and want to be free to charge forward and do what they please.</p>
					<p> They really hate people who are deceptive and try to take advantage of their innocence. They also hate lingering in the past; Aries is all about moving forward. People who complain a lot or feel sorry for themselves is another pet peeve of theirs. </p>

				<h2><img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>How to Approach an Aries</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>There usually will not be a need for you to approach an Aries on your own as they will take the initiative and introduce themselves with a friendly, energetic smile accompanied with a strong handshake. The most important concept to grasp when dealing with an Aries is that they are concentrated purely on themselves. That is NOT to say that they are selfish. On the contrary, Aries are very warm, generous, and helpful people. Aries are concentrated on expressing themselves to the world and others.</p>
					<p>Aries want to feel themselves being loved, touched, cared for, succeed, etc. They believe everyone feels that way and cannot imagine a different way for people to feel. Therefore, Aries might come across as a person who will not reciprocate feelings and good actions in relationships. This is not true; they are just too concentrated on how they feel by others' actions and forget everyone else. Aries want to be the leading force in any endeavor and you will do wisely if you allow them to do so. Arguing with an Aries is also a lost cause; once they are set on a way/opinion, they are the only one that can change it.</p> 
				    <p>Aries move from one idea/action to the next with the intense energy of Mars so you need to be fast enough to catch up; Aries slow down for no one. At times, Aries famous temper will flare up and they might even ram head first into you if you upset them. This flash of anger will fade soon and Aries will not even remember the ordeal so you best pretend it didn't occur either.</p>
				    <p>Aries are very verbally expressive of themselves and will often say things out loud or to people's faces that could upset them. Remember, they mean no harm at all. Aries are innocent and gullible and are sometimes lied to or cheated by those who recognize that in them. Rest assured, if and when they find out, that will be their first and last affair with that lier. Aries love receiving gifts.</p>

				<h2><img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <i>Relationship Aspirations</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Aries look for a mate from the fairy tales: beautiful, intelligent, always well-groomed, always smiling, sophisticated, and well-behaved. The female Aries despises a man that drools over her or is willing to be her slave. She likes a strong man who knows how to play hard to get. Once Aries are convinced they are in love, they will go at that person with the full force of the energy that Mars provides them. It is a burst of emotional energy and love that other signs are not used to experiencing.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Aries are a very jealous mate, both male and female, so their mates need to know not to flirt with anyone. On the flip-side, Aries hate having their freedom restricted by anyone and will sometime flirt with the opposite sex.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Aries are a very jealous mate, both male and female, so their mates need to know not to flirt with anyone. On the flip-side, Aries hate having their freedom restricted by anyone and will sometime flirt with the opposite sex. No need to worry, once Aries are set on a mate, it is very rare that they will cheat on her/him, especially since they loath dishonesty.</p>
					<p>Aries love cleanliness and their mates need to be well-groomed and clean around them. Aries want someone who is dynamic, energetic, and fun to be around. They are especially attracted to people who are mysterious, the ones who show much complexity and sophistication without anyone knowing how they do it. Most importantly, Aries want someone who will be a part of the most important thing in their life; themselves. Someone who will help Aries experience themselves through life's adventures. </p>
