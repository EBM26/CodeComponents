				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">C</span>ancer is the Cardinal stage of the Water element and is the only sign ruled by the Moon. The Moon receives its light from the Sun and then reflects it back to earth when it is dark. Cancer do the same; they collect and define (Cardinal Stage) emotions (Water element) from others in order to use them to care for other people in their times of need.</p>
					<p>Just as the Moon goes through a cycle of new, half, full, etc., so do Cancer's emotions; going from sad and depressed to happy and ecstatic for no particular reason. The Cardinal stage is what makes Cancer ambitious, independent, stubborn, and domineering. The Water element is what makes him intuitive, nurturing, compassionate, imaginative, and sensitive. </p>

				<img src="images/cancer-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's symbol is a crab. Just like the crabs have hard shells that protect their delicate and vulnerable bodies, so do Cancer have a tough emotional exterior that they retreats into when they feels attacked or vulnerable. This shell is an impenetrable fortress that is sometimes embodied by family, friends, or their homes; somewhere they can run to for safety, support, and hide from the cruel world. Cancer rely on this shell; to break it would mean their destruction.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Just like crabs use their pincers to ward off attackers, Cancer are known to "pinch" people verbally when they feel vulnerable.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Just like crabs use their pincers to ward off attackers, Cancer are known to "pinch" people verbally when they feel vulnerable. When crabs get a hold of something in their pincers, they will not let it go even at the cost of mutilation; Cancer similarly holds onto anything or anyone of sentimental value without easily letting go. Just like the crabs, Cancer never advance directly towards their target, always sideways while facing the target; sometimes taking a few steps back and going round and round until they find a safe way to approach.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer represents the "Puberty" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. After discovering the benefit and pleasure of communicating and making relationships with others during the "Childhood" stage of Gemini, the soul now begins a different journey in building relationships by relying on its intuitions and feelings rather than just thoughts and words as it did previously.</p>
					<p>This is the soul's first journey into its emotional side and it is quite scary for her. The soul is torn between the safe, welcoming place by her family and the need to further explore the world as a growing adult. Thus, the family, especially their mothers, is very important to Cancer as a means for emotional support. In this karmic stage, the soul is deeply concerned with securing emotional relationships with its close family and friends in order to gain self-confidence and emotional security. And thus, carefully and with many fears that the soul cannot share with others because it fears it might be misunderstood or ridiculed, the soul slowly advances towards the unknown and exciting aspects of life.</p>
					<p>Cancer's inner feelings go through mood swings just like a maturing teenager does. Cancer's life mantra is "I feel". They came to this world to teach that "love is dedication" and to learn that "love is freedom"; due to Cancer's difficulty in loosening up their grasp on people they care about. </p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Cancer</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer usually have a medium to short height; seldom very tall. Cancer are known to have a round body type while most of his weight is concentrated in the body itself rather than in the limbs. Cancer's face is usually round as well with a strong jaw line and winding eyebrows that seem to express a bid of sadness. Their most distinguished features are the three prominent points on their face that stick out; the ones located on their chin and cheekbones. Their eyes are usually small, squinty, and far from one another.</p>
					<p>In social scenes and when they are in a good mood, Cancer can be heard easily when they laugh their famous, loud "moon laugh" that travels up and down in its tone. Cancer will be the joker of the party or at least hanging around the person or people joking around. When they are not in a good mood, chances are that you will not find them outside of their homes.</p>

				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's strong traits are: imagination, dedication, gentleness, sensitivity towards others, and caution. Cancer are known as the "Mother" and "Caretaker" of the Zodiac since they are so caring of others and worry about their close friends and family. Cancer will go to great lengths to protect their close ones. Cancer have very powerful imaginations which they use to come up with business ideas which they are usually very successful at.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Cancer have very powerful imaginations which they use to come up with business ideas which they are usually very successful at.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Cancer are successful due to their ability to make the first move after carefully assessing the situation, and then working very hard and sticking to that move relentlessly until the task is complete. Cancer have a special talent of accumulating wealth. Both male and female Cancers are known to be masters of the house; keeping it clean, well furnished, and cooking meals that any chef would be proud of. They is also known for having a natural "green thumb". Cancer possesses a great sense of humor. </p>
					<p>Their strengths can potentially turn into weaknesses such as: stubbornness, cheapness, a short temper, sadness, fearfulness, co-dependency, and possessiveness. Cancer's emotional sensitivity is known to be of extreme measures; it doesn't take much to get this sign upset or sad. A harsh stare from a friend, an unanswered phone call to a relative, etc., and Cancer's emotions will be already riled up. Cancer close friends confide in them constantly because they feel Cancer actually care about them and will guard their secrets zealously; which is quite true. However, Cancer suffer alone and will even use humor and silliness to mislead others from discovering how they truly feels. Cancer sensitive emotions are influenced by the cycle of the Moon which makes Cancer a person who's mood constantly swings without a real reason. No use of trying to understand what Cancer is really feeling; they goes to extreme measures and stubbornness to hide their true feelings from most everyone except for a very select few they confide in.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer emotions are so powerful that they highly influence their physical well-being. When Cancer are happy, they are strong and energetic. When they are sad, they might easily become sick. Their powerful imagination may then add to this sickness by convincing Cancer that they are sicker than they actually are. Therefore, a good advice for Cancer would be to speak about their feelings to someone who they feel comfortable confiding in and is sensitive to their feelings. This friend can help them separate fact from fiction and provide much needed emotional support and relief.</p>
					<p>Since Cancer is a Water sign, they are vulnerable to addiction of substances such as alcohol and drugs in order to relieve themselves of their aching emotions. Cancer are also known to be susceptible to be addicted to sadness and retreat from the world into their own shell which they guard with all of their might. Again, the best advice for them is to have someone to confide in and gain strength from instead of retreating to sadness or substances. Talking out one's problems often provides much needed emotional relief.</p>
					<p>Everything in Cancer's world has a sentimental value, including people. This mentality fuels a strong trait of possessiveness within Cancer which makes it very difficult for them to let go of objects or people in their life, including the ones that are harmful to them. The obvious affects are that Cancer are sometimes lamenting a lost relationship or are stuck in one that is abusive to them. A good advice for Cancer would be to learn to let go of anyone or anything that is harmful to their lives or has already moved on. Once again, a close confidant could help them realize their needless possessiveness of unnecessary relationships.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer are big foodies. They typically like the smooth, creamy foods that go down well. Also, foods with a lot of water in them, such as fruits and vegetables, are a Cancer favorite. Needless to say that seafood is another favorite of theirs. Cancer enjoys being by the quiet waters so fishing is a natural Cancer hobby. The more courageous Cancer will indulge in the aggressive water sports such as water-skiing, surfing, etc.</p>
					<p> Making money is another beloved Cancer past-time. Money has a very special place in Cancer's life; to them it means security and safety. Cancer have a deep-rooted need for financial security and have constant fears that they do not have enough money for a possible "rainy day". This fear causes them to work hard, chase wealth, be frugal with their money, and never be satisfied with how much they have.</p> 
					<p>Cancer's clothes are contrived of articles of clothing that posses a sentimental value to them. For Cancer, it is more important how the article of clothing makes them feel rather than how they look in it. The home is Cancer's shrine; it is their getaway fortress from the stresses and dangers of the outer world. Therefore, Cancer love to furnish, equip, and spend a lot of time at home. Playing the role of the jokester is another Cancer hobby; so is wrestling which allows them to incorporate their defensive skills. </p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Due to Cancer's high emotional sensitivity, they naturally dislike people or situations which are hurtful towards their feelings or the feelings of their loved ones. In fact, there is nothing that gets Cancer more riled up than someone trying to harm their friends or families, especially their mothers. In such a scenario, Cancer muster up all their strength to defend their most precious life possessions; their loved ones. Cancer are very careful and weigh all of their options heavily before making a move. Therefore, they highly dislike being rushed to make a decision or being hurried in general. Truth be told, trying to control a Cancer is a sure-fire way to make them angry. Messy homes are another pet peeve of a Cancer; so are people who squander their money or like to show off their wealth. Cancer highly dislikes being in dangerous or volatile situations. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Cancer</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer are very caring and loving people who take their friendly relationships quite seriously. Unlike other signs that might friend someone for a specific purpose, Cancer only become friends with someone they like and want to be their friend forever. You see, for a Cancer, relationships are meant to last forever. It takes something very extreme to break the emotional grasp a Cancer have on their loved ones. In Cancer you will find a sweet, caring, reliable, and funny companion.</p> 
					<p>Since Cancer is ruled by the Moon, they seek to absorb the warmth, kindness, strength, and support their friends and families shower upon them just like the Moon absorbs light from the Sun. However, don't expect Cancer to call a friend and share their deep feelings with them. Cancer will go to great lengths to hide their true, fragile emotions from everyone except a very limited, select few that they absolutely trust. Instead, they will call their friend and brag about an accomplishment or something similar in an attempt to receive compliments and praise. All they want are reassurance and affirmations of themselves so that they can deal with their fears and insecurities.</p> 
					<p>The above interaction generally outlines Cancer's modus operandi, they approach matters sideways, circling round and round until they gets what they want; they are never upfront and forward about matters. Cancer experience constant mood swings that they cannot control and so you should be ready that some days they might retreat to themselves in sadness or be extra touchy and irritated, while other days they might be energetic and playful. Sensitivity and patience are always key when dealing with a Cancer.</p>

				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer thrive upon building close, intimate relationships with people they like so a romantic relationship, and especially marriage, is quite natural for them. To Cancer, marriage is the embodiment of emotional stability with someone they love; something Cancer highly value. Cancer's spouse will find them to be very devoted, reliable, caring, and great at financial management.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">The Cancer male is very close to his mother and often looks for a wife he can compare to her.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>The male Cancer is very romantic and will go to great lengths to win his love's hand. He is quite the gentleman and treats ladies with much respect. The Cancer male is very close to his mother and often looks for a wife he can compare to her. This potential candidate will do wisely to be very nice and develop a solid relationship with Cancer's mother. She would also do wisely to be careful on how she spends her money. The male Cancer will take time choosing the right woman to be his wife due to his fear of getting hurt; once he has found her, he won't easily let her go.</p>
					<p>The female Cancer can be a lot fun, especially during the time when she is emotionally positive. If you want to see her like you've never seen her before, take your lady Cancer to a stroll on the beach during a full moon. The combination of water and the moon at its brightest will unlock feelings even she is not aware of. The female Cancer looks for a man who is careful with her fragile emotions; one who will reassure her when she feels insecure. She also looks for a man that knows how to be careful with his finances. Female Cancers make absolutely excellent housewives; caring for every detail in the house and cooking extraordinary meals. Needless to say, both male and female Cancers are jealous lovers. </p>
