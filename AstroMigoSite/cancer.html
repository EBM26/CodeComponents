				<h2><i>Sign Overview</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer is the Cardinal stage of the Water element and is the only sign ruled by the Moon. The Moon receives its light from the Sun and then reflects it back to earth when it is dark. Cancer do the same; they collect and define (Cardinal Stage) emotions (Water element) from others in order to use them to care for other people in their times of need. Just as the Moon goes through a cycle of new, half, full, etc., so do Cancer's emotions; going from sad and depressed to happy and ecstatic for no particular reason. The Cardinal stage is what makes Cancer ambitious, independent, stubborn, and domineering. The Water element is what makes him intuitive, nurturing, compassionate, imaginative, and sensitive. </p>

				<h2><i>Symbol Meaning</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's symbol is a crab. Just like the crabs have hard shells that protect their delicate and vulnerable bodies, so do Cancer have a tough emotional exterior that they retreats into when they feels attacked or vulnerable. This shell is an impenetrable fortress that is sometimes embodied by family, friends, or their homes; somewhere they can run to for safety, support, and hide from the cruel world. Cancer rely on this shell; to break it would mean their destruction. Just like crabs use their pincers to ward off attackers, Cancer are known to "pinch" people verbally when they feel vulnerable. When crabs get a hold of something in their pincers, they will not let it go even at the cost of mutilation; Cancer similarly holds onto anything or anyone of sentimental value without easily letting go. Just like the crabs, Cancer never advance directly towards their target, always sideways while facing the target; sometimes taking a few steps back and going round and round until they find a safe way to approach.</p>

				<h2><i>Karmic Stage</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer represents the "Puberty" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. After discovering the benefit and pleasure of communicating and making relationships with others during the "Childhood" stage of Gemini, the soul now begins a different journey in building relationships by relying on its intuitions and feelings rather than just thoughts and words as it did previously. This is the soul's first journey into its emotional side and it is quite scary for her. The soul is torn between the safe, welcoming place by her family and the need to further explore the world as a growing adult. Thus, the family, especially their mothers, is very important to Cancer as a means for emotional support. In this karmic stage, the soul is deeply concerned with securing emotional relationships with its close family and friends in order to gain self-confidence and emotional security. And thus, carefully and with many fears that the soul cannot share with others because it fears it might be misunderstood or ridiculed, the soul slowly advances towards the unknown and exciting aspects of life. Cancer's inner feelings go through mood swings just like a maturing teenager does. Cancer's life mantra is "I feel". They came to this world to teach that "love is dedication" and to learn that "love is freedom"; due to Cancer's difficulty in loosening up their grasp on people they care about. </p>

				<h2><i>How to Spot a Cancer</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer usually have a medium to short height; seldom very tall. Cancer are known to have a round body type while most of his weight is concentrated in the body itself rather than in the limbs. Cancer's face is usually round as well with a strong jaw line and winding eyebrows that seem to express a bid of sadness. Their most distinguished features are the three prominent points on their face that stick out; the ones located on their chin and cheekbones. Their eyes are usually small, squinty, and far from one another. In social scenes and when they are in a good mood, Cancer can be heard easily when they laugh their famous, loud "moon laugh" that travels up and down in its tone. Cancer will be the joker of the party or at least hanging around the person or people joking around. When they are not in a good mood, chances are that you will not find them outside of their homes.</p>

				<h2><i>Potential Strengths vs. Potential Weaknesses</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's strong traits are: imagination, dedication, gentleness, sensitivity towards others, and caution. Cancer are known as the "Mother" and "Caretaker" of the Zodiac since they are so caring of others and worry about their close friends and family. Cancer will go to great lengths to protect their close ones. Cancer have very powerful imaginations which they use to come up with business ideas which they are usually very successful at. Cancer are successful due to their ability to make the first move after carefully assessing the situation, and then working very hard and sticking to that move relentlessly until the task is complete. Cancer have a special talent of accumulating wealth. Both male and female Cancers are known to be masters of the house; keeping it clean, well furnished, and cooking meals that any chef would be proud of. They is also known for having a natural "green thumb". Cancer possesses a great sense of humor. </p>

				<h2><i>Pitfalls vs. Good Paths in Life</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Just as Cancer minds move very fast, so does their attention on the current subject they are putting effort into. In the beginning, they will find a subject/matter/person highly interesting and will put a lot of mental effort and time into it. As time progresses, their excitement dies down and/or they stumbles across something more interesting (which happens very often). They will then abandon that interest completely and divert their full attention towards their new interest. This results in Cancer having many unfinished, brilliant ideas that could help their lives if only they would complete them. A good advice would be for them to partner up with someone more stable (like a Taurus or a Virgo) in order to make sure the project is finished or have a third party with a strong influence on them keep tabs on the progress. Cancer curiosity leads them to explore and understand many new, useful, and interesting things in life. It also can lead them to dangerous grounds and harmful decisions. Their hasty movements and thirsty curiosity can lead them to visit a dangerous place, trust in strangers, leave profitable positions, etc. A good advice would be for them to weigh their decisions carefully, perhaps with the aid of a third party. Cancer have an uncanny talent to manipulate words and concepts. This may lead to other people perceiving them as deceitful or two-faced. The truth is, Cancer naturally see many sides to every coin and that is how they actually think. A good advice would be for them to be careful on how they word their thoughts with those who have simpler minds than them, and maybe sometimes "dumb down" the way they talk. Cancer have a tendency to take on more than they can handle sometimes. When that happens, their fear and anxiety levels shoot up high as their restless mind conjures up endless worst-case scenarios of what could happen if they fail their tasks. It is no wonder that many Cancer suffer from sleepless nights. A good advice would be to consider carefully how much they can handle at once, get a like-minded, quick-witted assistant if needed, and meditate often to sooth that over-worked mental machine of his.</p>

				<h2><i>Likes / Hobbies</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer enjoy activities that are fast-paced, diverse, interesting, and give their mind a good workout. They also would like to exercise their other talent while doing things; communicating with others. Therefore, the racket sports such as: tennis, badminton, etc. are often Cancer's favorite sport. They allow them to be light on their feet, move constantly, and engage in a friendly conversation with their opponent while playing. Cancer love board games, especially those that challenge their thinking skills. They love to exercise their writing skills and will often have a column, blog, book, etc. that they are writing on the side if they aren't doing that already for a living. Another fun past-time of Cancer is tinkering with inventions, electronics, gadgets, etc. that require minimum physical effort and maximum mental effort. Cancer are not big foodies and will sometimes forget to eat if they are engulfed in nourishing their intellectual hunger. When they do eat, they like to have variety in their foods and eat light foods that don't weigh them down. Cancer are not particular about clothing. They prefer the lighter colors such as yellow, blue, pink, etc. and clothes that allow them freedom of movement. Cancer have a favorite weakness; gambling. The rush of the unknown and the possibility to make a large sum of money with minimum effort enchants them greatly. Cancer absolutely love to travel and have endless dreams of exploring the whole world, different cultures, and new people.</p>

				<h2><i>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's biggest dislike in this world is feeling tied down to anything for a long time, especially if that thing is boring or lacks variety. Cancer's mind works at a very fast pace and so they get bored quickly with something they have already done or someone they have already spent time with. Cancer need the freedom and possibility to engage their minds with constant new objects/people/ideas/etc. Being in a position that they feel restricted by someone or something stifles them and brings them down. Boredom is Cancer's enemy, and so is being tied down to static, daily responsibilities. Cancer love to play on words and often playfully say random things. This can be fun and entertaining if taken lightly. If taken literally, though, it can mean trouble. Therefore Cancer dislikes being around people who take their words too seriously or are not playful. </p>

				<h2><i>How to Approach an Cancer</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer love to meet new people and engage in conversations; they does so in a quick manner, both physically and mentally. For these reasons, Cancer are more likely to introduce themselves to you before you even have a chance of spotting them in the room. They will swiftly and stealthily land next to you like a humming bird on a flower, and then make a witty remark or observation about something to you. This will result in a long conversation and them asking many questions in order to mentally grasp the new person they just met and evaluate whether this person is interesting enough to spend more time with. Occasionally, Cancer will engage in a long conversation with a person they is not particularly fond of just for the sake of talking. This happens due to Cancer's need to form their numerous ideas into words and they need an audience for that. In return for your listening ear, they will provide you with new information and perspectives that they have thought up. Cancer also enjoy it when the people who are listening to them provide their own, different, intellectual perspective on the subject at hand so that they can compare and contrast with the info/opinion they have in order to form a final, refined opinion. Cancer are not in any need of honor, support, favor, or understanding. All they want is a mentally stimulating, adventurous, fun companion that they can occasionally engage in conversation, travel with, or just have fun with. If you want Cancer to like you and spend more time with you, all you need to do is sharpen your wits, be up-to-date with the latest news/gadgets/events, and be interesting and intriguing enough to keep them curious. With all that in mind, you should note a few important matters about having a relationship with a Cancer: First, Cancer have a lot of friends who enjoy their company and they like to rotate between all of them so that they can be updated as much as possible with all of them and have a large variety in their companionship. Second, Cancer are not one to be ordered around or restricted by any means; this includes heavy emotional involvement. Cancer are too light and versatile to be tied down to any particular emotion for a long time and are often thought of as cold-hearted. Therefore, they are not a friend you should call in emotional distress or expect to have around you all the time. Just be grateful for the time they spend with you and consult them in what he's great at; contrasting ideas and providing new information or perspectives. Third, Cancer decide to do things very quickly. The problem is that this decision might change just as quickly and so Cancer are known to be "flaky" people. The truth is, they really meant it when they said yes, it's just that something else grabbed their attention. Again, Cancer are not a friend to be tied down or called upon with an important, long term responsibility. If you understand and incorporate these concepts, you will find Cancer to be very fun and entertaining companions. No use lying to these friends; their sharp, perceptive mind can see through lies quickly and generally have a great talent of understanding the people and situations in front of them. They won't hold it against you if you do decide to try to lie to them; fights, arguments, battles of pride, etc. do not concern Cancer at all. Since Cancer is made of a set of twins, you might find that your companion's character might change from time to time. At times they will embody the haughty, fun-loving, social, adventurous twin. Other times they will embody the nervous, shy, cautious, evasive twin. Don't worry, this is perfectly normal. Cancer have wild imaginations that are fueled by their restless minds and often say and plan things they don't really have the intention of doing. Cancer also like to cover their tracks and elude others about their intentions or plans; it is a way for them to ensure their freedom. </p>

				<h2><i>Relationship Aspirations</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer are in search of relationships with partners that are fun, adventurous, intelligent, diverse, easy-going, and fast-paced. They are not looking for someone who is too serious and especially not for relationships that involve intense emotional investments. This ideal mate needs to be someone who will always be available to ward off the loneliness Cancer so very fears yet not be dependent on Cancer always being there for him/her. This mate needs to understand the free-spirited, hyper-active mind that hides behind Cancer's playful eyes and provide them with diverse entertainment, intellectual stimulation, new adventures, and the freedom to explore on their own when they need it. Cancer are also in need of someone with a grounded manner who can take care of them physically, provide some stability, and provide the safety they need when they gets into a state of anxiety or fear. This mate needs to understand that Cancer's mutable character changes have nothing to do with him/her. Cancer is not one to turn away from another person's smile; be it man, woman, or child. They are naturally playful and social. The opposite sex is often charmed by them and they have many admirers. Nevertheless, if Cancer's mate gives them trust, faith, belief, and freedom, they will not betray him/her.</p>
