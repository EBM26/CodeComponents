				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">C</span>ancer is the Cardinal stage of the Water element and is the only sign ruled by the Moon. The Moon receives its light from the Sun and then reflects it back to earth when it is dark. Cancer do the same; they collect and define (Cardinal Stage) emotions (Water element) from others in order to use them to care for other people in their times of need.</p>
					<p>Just as the Moon goes through a cycle of new, half, full, etc., so do Cancer's emotions; going from sad and depressed to happy and ecstatic for no particular reason. The Cardinal stage is what makes Cancer ambitious, independent, stubborn, and domineering. The Water element is what makes him intuitive, nurturing, compassionate, imaginative, and sensitive. </p>

				<img src="images/cancer-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's symbol is a crab. Just like the crabs have hard shells that protect their delicate and vulnerable bodies, so do Cancer have a tough emotional exterior that they retreats into when they feels attacked or vulnerable. This shell is an impenetrable fortress that is sometimes embodied by family, friends, or their homes; somewhere they can run to for safety, support, and hide from the cruel world. Cancer rely on this shell; to break it would mean their destruction.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Just like crabs use their pincers to ward off attackers, Cancer are known to "pinch" people verbally when they feel vulnerable.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Just like crabs use their pincers to ward off attackers, Cancer are known to "pinch" people verbally when they feel vulnerable. When crabs get a hold of something in their pincers, they will not let it go even at the cost of mutilation; Cancer similarly holds onto anything or anyone of sentimental value without easily letting go. Just like the crabs, Cancer never advance directly towards their target, always sideways while facing the target; sometimes taking a few steps back and going round and round until they find a safe way to approach.</p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer represents the "Puberty" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. After discovering the benefit and pleasure of communicating and making relationships with others during the "Childhood" stage of Gemini, the soul now begins a different journey in building relationships by relying on its intuitions and feelings rather than just thoughts and words as it did previously.</p>
					<p>This is the soul's first journey into its emotional side and it is quite scary for her. The soul is torn between the safe, welcoming place by her family and the need to further explore the world as a growing adult. Thus, the family, especially their mothers, is very important to Cancer as a means for emotional support. In this karmic stage, the soul is deeply concerned with securing emotional relationships with its close family and friends in order to gain self-confidence and emotional security. And thus, carefully and with many fears that the soul cannot share with others because it fears it might be misunderstood or ridiculed, the soul slowly advances towards the unknown and exciting aspects of life.</p>
					<p>Cancer's inner feelings go through mood swings just like a maturing teenager does. Cancer's life mantra is "I feel". They came to this world to teach that "love is dedication" and to learn that "love is freedom"; due to Cancer's difficulty in loosening up their grasp on people they care about. </p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Cancer</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer usually have a medium to short height; seldom very tall. Cancer are known to have a round body type while most of his weight is concentrated in the body itself rather than in the limbs. Cancer's face is usually round as well with a strong jaw line and winding eyebrows that seem to express a bid of sadness. Their most distinguished features are the three prominent points on their face that stick out; the ones located on their chin and cheekbones. Their eyes are usually small, squinty, and far from one another.</p>
					<p>In social scenes and when they are in a good mood, Cancer can be heard easily when they laugh their famous, loud "moon laugh" that travels up and down in its tone. Cancer will be the joker of the party or at least hanging around the person or people joking around. When they are not in a good mood, chances are that you will not find them outside of their homes.</p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Cancer's strong traits are: imagination, dedication, gentleness, sensitivity towards others, and caution. Cancer are known as the "Mother" and "Caretaker" of the Zodiac since they are so caring of others and worry about their close friends and family. Cancer will go to great lengths to protect their close ones. Cancer have very powerful imaginations which they use to come up with business ideas which they are usually very successful at.</p>

					<p>Cancer are successful due to their ability to make the first move after carefully assessing the situation, and then working very hard and sticking to that move relentlessly until the task is complete. Cancer have a special talent of accumulating wealth. Both male and female Cancers are known to be masters of the house; keeping it clean, well furnished, and cooking meals that any chef would be proud of. They is also known for having a natural "green thumb". Cancer possesses a great sense of humor. </p>

				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Just as Cancer minds move very fast, so does their attention on the current subject they are putting effort into. In the beginning, they will find a subject/matter/person highly interesting and will put a lot of mental effort and time into it. As time progresses, their excitement dies down and/or they stumbles across something more interesting (which happens very often). They will then abandon that interest completely and divert their full attention towards their new interest. This results in Cancer having many unfinished, brilliant ideas that could help their lives if only they would complete them. A good advice would be for them to partner up with someone more stable (like a Taurus or a Virgo) in order to make sure the project is finished or have a third party with a strong influence on them keep tabs on the progress. Cancer curiosity leads them to explore and understand many new, useful, and interesting things in life. It also can lead them to dangerous grounds and harmful decisions. Their hasty movements and thirsty curiosity can lead them to visit a dangerous place, trust in strangers, leave profitable positions, etc. A good advice would be for them to weigh their decisions carefully, perhaps with the aid of a third party. Cancer have an uncanny talent to manipulate words and concepts. This may lead to other people perceiving them as deceitful or two-faced. The truth is, Cancer naturally see many sides to every coin and that is how they actually think. A good advice would be for them to be careful on how they word their thoughts with those who have simpler minds than them, and maybe sometimes "dumb down" the way they talk. Cancer have a tendency to take on more than they can handle sometimes. When that happens, their fear and anxiety levels shoot up high as their restless mind conjures up endless worst-case scenarios of what could happen if they fail their tasks. It is no wonder that many Cancer suffer from sleepless nights. A good advice would be to consider carefully how much they can handle at once, get a like-minded, quick-witted assistant if needed, and meditate often to sooth that over-worked mental machine of his.</p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Taurus love their comfort and sensuality and everything that provides these for them. Soothing music and comfortable clothes that make them look good are very popular with Taurus.  They love food, especially fatty foods like steak, chocolates, and creams.  Taurus' love for food is both physical and spiritual: food makes them feel so good both emotionally and physically.  Taurus love their homes and love to furnish them with their possessions, which are usually very big in size. </p>

					<p>They love to be surrounded by their possessions and the people who appreciate them because that gives them assurance.  Taurus love to be touched and caressed softly.  They work hard and like their peace and quiet time, so please, just give them some and understand.  Taurus like to collect wealth and be financially stable, then use this money to buy themselves more comfort and pleasure.  Taurus love nature and earth and have a longing to live somewhere pastoral and natural; like a farm, for instance.</p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Taurus hate fast changes and starting things over again.  They hate irresponsibility, dishonesty, disloyalty, and wasting energy for no reason.  Taurus usually dislike loud-mouthed people that talk a lot. They believe that rules were made to protect everyone and ensure stability and therefore hate breaking the rules and causing trouble or people who do so constantly.</p>
					<p>Taurus hate being bossed around or controlled (even though they might do so themselves).  They hate being disturbed during their quiet time and the act of someone invading their "territory" can drive them mad. Taurus is very territorial and keeps a vigilant watch over their "space", loved ones, and properties. </p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach an Taurus</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Taurus are naturally mistrusting and careful of others. Therefore one must approach a Taurus gently, making sure not to overstep one's boundary by asking personal questions that revolve around his intimate matters of life such as his love life, his financial matters, etc. Loud talking and public spectacles are also a wrong way to approach the quiet, calm Taurus.</p>
					<p>Although they show little or no emotions, they are very sensitive and their feelings can be easily hurt. Therefore one must chose their words carefully when speaking to a Taurus about personal matters. Trust is extremely important to them because it resonates with their need for stability. If Taurus deem someone deceitful or incompetent, that person has a very small chance of regaining their trust. Once one has gained the trust and favor of a Taurus, one will find them to be a very honest, caring, and dependable friend. Taurus like to be touched by their loved ones and communicates a lot through touch.</p>
					<p>One must be aware of the Taurus' tendency to control their surroundings and the people that surround them. Their intentions are purely helpful and not to be disrespected. If one is experiencing difficulty with this or any other of their behaviors, one must make sure to tell them in a gentle manner. A soft touch, compassionate eyes, friendly smile, and a polite request can achieve almost anything with a Taurus. Anger, arguments, blame, criticism etc. will result in Taurus becoming very stubborn and defensive. Taurus rarely argues their point or way, they just does what they feels is right and disregard the rest.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Relationship Aspirations</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Taurus are motivated fully by their need to give and receive physical stability and security. They do not have a true sense of themselves until they connect themselves to their surrounding and their close relationships. Taurus do so by providing their loved ones with physical security such as protection, food, finance, etc. in a hope that they will be treated well in return.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Taurus are very easily hurt emotionally and want someone who will be gentle with their feelings.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p> Taurus are very easily hurt emotionally and want someone who will be gentle with their feelings. They also want someone that they can provide for and call their "own", thus connecting to him/her. Since Taurus seek to gain stability, it is very likely that a female Taurus will want someone with a solid job and financial stability. The male Taurus will look for someone who can care for him on a more physical level such as cooking, cleaning, etc.</p>
					<p>Both sexes will like someone who is outgoing and independent yet will stay away from loud and out of control individuals or ones that are promiscuous/not trustworthy. Both sexes like a strong minded mate yet would like to maintain control at all times. Someone sensual like them is a big plus. Taurus usually do not initiate the first move in relationships; they wait for the right opportunity.  </p>
