				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">C</span>apricorn is the Cardinal stage of the Earth element and is ruled by the solar side of Saturn. This means that they use Saturn's energy of giving things a final shape in order to achieve and amount (Cardinal stage) material (Earth element) goals. Saturn is at the edge of the solar and lunar astrological cycle. While the rest of the planets are busy promoting growth and change, Saturn is busy finalizing the structures and skeletons that shape the universe. It is the energy source of rules, regulations, frameworks, and traditions. Without Saturn, the Universe would not hold structurally. Saturn is also in charge of time. Unlike the rest of the planets that provide a burst of energy for a short period of time, Saturn gives energy for long-lasting results.</p> 
					<p>It is this energy of Saturn that makes Capricorn hard workers, serious in their manners, traditional, highly disciplined, and an over-achiever. The Cardinal stage is what makes them active, self-motivated, ambitious, stubborn, independent, domineering, and forceful. The Earth element is what makes them physically strong, stable, humble, sensual, earthly, and realistic.</p>

				<img src="images/capricorn-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn's symbol is a goat. This is represented in Capricorn by their constant endeavor to reach the top of the financial/professional mountain just as the goat works hard to climb to the top of the mountain. Just like a goat, Capricorn are tough, resilient, energetic, stubborn, don't eat much, and motivated.</p> 
					<p>In astrology, Capricorn's goat has a fish's tail to it (it is also known that the Greeks had an animal called a sea-goat). Many speculations have been made as to the origin of this tail and its meaning. The agreed belief is that the tail represents the Water element which holds the energy of emotions and spirituality.</p> 
					<p>What does the Water element have to do with our earthly Capricorn? It represents their wisdom of experience that they have accumulated with their old age and the wisdom of past generations they so devoutly admire and follow. It also represents that although Capricorn are propelled to move forward by their emotions like a fish is propelled in the water by its tail, they keep their head above the emotional waters in order to maintain a rational, cool, objective manner. Despite the deep-rooted, strong emotions that Capricorn have, they follow their logic and buries those emotions deep inside. </p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn represents the "Experience" or "Old Age" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. This is the stage when the soul puts aside the rest of the world and concentrates on itself and its close family members. Capricorn do not need to be flamboyant, impulsive, or rule over people aggressively in order to lead; they can do so with the wisdom, carefulness, and soft manner of a kind grandparent. The serious mannered Capricorn firmly hold on to the traditions, values, beliefs, and ceremonies of their predecessors. They have lived long enough to know not to change what others have done for centuries. This wise, old sign has a lot of respect and reverence towards authority.</p>

					<p>Capricorn may not be the most fun, adventurous, risk-taking person you meet; there's not much time for those things at their old age. Their life mantra is "I use", as Capricorn are very practical. They came to teach that "love is wisdom" and to learn that "love is letting go", as the determined Capricorn have a very hard time letting go of something they worked so hard to achieve.</p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Capricorn</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn mix and blur unconsciously into the background as a quiet shadow. Therefore it is unusually difficult to spot a Capricorn immediately. They are usually medium or short height, rarely tall. They are usually well-built and have a good structural outline. Capricorn have a compact, almost condensed look to them, as though they have been made with as little material as possible as to not waste any. Capricorn will appear grounded as if they are planted inside the ground until they decides to move to another spot. This sign usually has strong legs.</p> 
					<p>There is often a twist somewhere the Capricorn physique; sometimes one shoulder is much higher than the other, or one knee is slightly askew so that their walk is imbalanced. All their movements are rather stiff and defensive. Capricorn usually have a serious manner to them and a slight sadness, since they find it difficult to escape their hereditary self-discipline and forced abstinence that this sign comes with. Nevertheless, they are a tough breed that can withstand pressure, insult, disappointment, and other hardships that life throws at them and eventually come out victorious. Capricorns aren't extravagant people nor are they ones to attract attention by loud noises, actions, flamboyant or skimpy clothes.</p>

				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn's strong traits are: determination, stability, wisdom, dependability, hard-working, diligence, serenity, and self-assurance. Capricorn has unlimited ambition and determination to reach their ultimate goal of success, power, prestige, and status. They have a very diligent, hard-working manner that allows them to climb to the top even if it takes them longer than others. While all the other signs exert energy quickly and cannot go on after a long amount of time, Capricorn is still pushing forward. They have built-in wisdom and cool-headed restraint that keep them from making foolish mistakes other hot-headed and moody signs make. Their mind operates in a very logical and systematic way. This same Saturn logic reality also causes them some pain and sadness in their lives.</p> 
					<p>Capricorn's potential weak traits are: selfishness, bigotry, inflexibility, snobbery, excessive greed, and a tendency towards depression and loneliness. Their practical, cynical manner causes them to see the world as a hard place and restricts their imagination from seeing a bright and hopeful possible outcome. Thus, their views of what the future holds for them can often be gloomy, which causes them to have fears and anxieties. This pessimism also causes Capricorn to sometimes linger in depression and melancholy. Capricorn often lack self-confidence and think of themselves as not good enough, not worthy enough, not good looking enough, etc. They are very healthy and tough physically although they usually suffer from sensitive skin. Capricorn usually live long lives. They have a hard time expressing themselves freely.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn are very realistic and logical which helps them achieve their goals without being distracted by their emotions. However, this same logical and realistic thinking causes them to be pessimistic and cold which can backfire on them. The pessimism can cause them fears and anxieties about what the future holds and about not achieving their coveted goals in life. A good advice is for them to work on seeing the bright side of things and also keep a friend/confidant that will help lift their spirits through their dark times.</p> 
					<p>Capricorn's cold manners can cause problems with their loved ones around them when they feel their Capricorn friend/lover/family member is being selfish, snobbish, or not reciprocating. The truth is, Capricorn are very warm on the inside and just need to work on expressing this warmth for the sake of their loved ones that they so dearly cares about. They also need to be careful not to be consumed by greed, lust of prestige or power, and jealousy of others while they are climbing their way to the top.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn are far too serious and busy working to have time for hobbies or games. The very limited time they have not working is spent with their family; the other love of their lives. Nonetheless, if Capricorn do decide to play games, they are very competitive and work hard to win since status is so important to them. The outdoor pastime they enjoy most is hiking, just like the mountain goat likes to climb the mountains. Capricorn enjoy physical activities that incorporate toughness and endurance over strength and speed such as marathon running, rock climbing, long-distance cycling, etc. Unlike the other Earth signs, Capricorn are not big or particular on food. In fact, they will often neglect eating if their work gets too demanding. Traditional foods taste especially good to a Capricorn since their family history and tradition are so important to them.</p>

					<p> There are two types of Capricorn when it comes to fashion; the ones that are dressed to impress and the ones that don't really care about their attire since sloppy clothes represent that they work so hard. When Capricorn does dress up, it is usually traditional, serious, and classy attire. Capricorn like the serious colors such as gray, black, and other dark shades.They also like to show power and success with their clothes so you should expect the expensive brands and high quality materials if they have the means. There is nothing Capricorn enjoys more than receiving status/honor/respect they deserve for their accomplishments. </p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn dislike breaking the rules and old traditions set by their predecessors. They value the morals and family values given to them as a child and view people who are liberal with these values to be destroying the future of society. Therefore you would usually see the Capricorn on the more conservative side of the spectrum. Capricorn hate laziness and unproductiveness. Anyone who is not working hard to improve their own financial and social status is frowned upon by the Capricorn. The same goes for people or situations that lack clear goals.</p> 
					<p>Unpredictability is also a pet peeve of Capricorn; they have everything planned well ahead of time and do not enjoy surprises. Never attempt to interfere with Capricorn doing their job, they see that as an offense of the first degree since they consider themselves the only authority on the matter. Capricorn also dislike public display of affection, lewdness, or any extravagant showing off since they are modest and gentle souls.</p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Capricorn</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn are usually the shy, quiet type that almost disappear in the background. Therefore, in order to meet a Capricorn, you will probably have to be the one to approach them. But cool your jets, Capricorn are very careful about who they bring into their life. They build relationships slowly and carefully, and they build them to last forever. For Capricorn, reliability and loyalty are very important. Therefore, they cool their emotions as usual and approach the person at hand in a very calculated way.</p> 
					<p>Capricorn also wans to see how the relationship will be productive to them. They calibrate the nature of the person at hand and fit him/her into their appropriate place within their own lives. Thus, Capricorn will have a friend that they go hiking with, a friend for chatting or venting, a friend that they discuss financial matters, etc. No friend will ever cross over to a category they do not belong to.</p> 
					<p>Capricorn are very loyal and loving friends although they might seem "cold" in their attitudes towards you. You will seldom receive compliments or warm affections from them. Rest assured, Capricorn are extremely fond of you if they are spending their precious time with you; Capricorn just expect you to understand how much they value you without them expressing it clearly. Capricorn are not gushy, moody people that freely expresses their emotions. It might seem that Capricorn do not want to be complimented or praised either; that couldn't be farther from the truth. Capricorn love to be complimented and admired; so lavish away, just make sure your compliments are sincere and reflect reality. </p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Capricorn treat romantic relationships like every matter; in a cool, careful, and calculated manner with long-term plans for the future. He or she seeks a mate that will help the Capricorn build a family and home in the tradition of their past generations. He is not one to emotionally rush into love and makes sure first that it is a relationship that can last for a long term with the right person (unless he has a different function in this particular relationship which he will clearly define and share with his mate). It is important to the Capricorn that this person be accomplished and ambitious like him, although he wants to be the main partner in the relationship. Some of the Capricorn females will marry for financial or social status reasons. Capricorn wants to be with someone who reflects their goals, values, and morals. People who change their opinions, goals, or are generally unpredictable or very liberal need not apply. </p>
