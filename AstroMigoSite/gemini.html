				<h2><i>Sign Overview</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini is the Mutable stage of the Air element and is ruled by the lunar side of Mercury. This means that they use Mercury's energy of highlighting differences in order to convert (Mutable stage) ideas and communications (Air element) into new concepts. The energy of Mercury does not have long term influence. It highlights the difference between two or more things/concepts, which then become part of the establishment, and then it moves to something new. Gemini act the same way: they contrast between two things/ideas/words/people/etc., distinguish the difference between them and thus define them, then quickly move to the next item. The Mutable stage is what makes Gemini flexible, love change, be complex, be highly adaptable, and very resourceful. The Air element is what makes them great communicators, analytical, curious, intellectual, social, detached, and easy flowing.</p>

				<h2><i>Symbol Meaning</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini's symbol is two twins. The word gemini is translated from the Latin word didymoi, which means "the twins". Sources attribute them to being Castor and Pollux, the famous twins from Greek Mythology. Both born to a mortal mother, Pollux was the son of Zeus and thus immortal. Castor was the son of a mortal father and thus mortal. They took part in many heroic adventures together until Castor's inevitable death. Pollux begged his father, Zeus, to let him die with Castor so that they will be together in death as they were in life. Zeus decided to let them be together in life by allowing Castor to share in Pollux's immortality and eternal life while Pollux had to share in Castor's mortality and potential death. The twin symbolism is represented in Gemini by his duality of thought and ideals, always seeing two sides of every concept, thing, and issue. This is the reason that many people mistake Gemini to have a split personality while in reality they just have many perspectives. Since the Greek twins were mortal and immortal, Gemini also have those two sides to them. At times, they are arrogant, cocky, and fearless like an immortal; other times they are scared, nervous, and timid as a mortal.</p>

				<h2><i>Karmic Stage</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini represent the "Child" or "Childhood" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. No longer needing to scream or wait patiently to receive what they need as they did in the earlier Aries and Taurus stages, the child-like Gemini soul have learned to use its uncanny communication abilities to ask for what they need and lean from others. This is also the stage in human development when mental capabilities are developed, which is why Gemini's greatest strength is their mind.  Just like a child, Gemini are very curious and want to explore everything around them. They have a child-like joy and excitement to them and are also saddened by the hardships of discipline and responsibility which limit their freedom of fun and exploration. In this karmic stage, the soul becomes aware of its surroundings and the differences between themselves and the people around them. And thus, Gemini love to meet new people so they can compare and contrast themselves to others, which makes them develop very sharp social skills. Their life mantra is "I think". They came to teach that "love is awareness" and to learn that "love is emotion" since their cold, calculated thinking leaves little room for emotions.</p>

				<h2><i>How to Spot a Gemini</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini usually have a tall, narrow body. Their bodies are quite well-balanced in both upper and lower sections. The most distinguished features of a Gemini are that they talks constantly about everything and anything, making many fast hand gestures while doing so. Their eyes are very playful and constantly move from one location to the next; never resting on one object for more than a couple of seconds. Gemini very friendly, smiley, and joyful. Their curiosity gives them away as they asks many questions while they try to wrap their analytical mind around the person they are talking to. Their movements are very light, quick, and swift; almost like humming bird. </p>

				<h2><i>Pitfalls vs. Good Paths in Life</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini's strong traits are: versatility, mental alertness, quick-perception, flexibility, logical thinking, and great communication abilities. Gemini are said to be able to read and understand everything, and from here lies their talent for different languages. Their mind is very sharp; they understands and learns new things at a very fast pace. Gemini's ability to see two sides of every concept/situation makes them very good at cataloging, categorizing, defining, and qualifying things/people/concepts/etc. They are a master of persuasion and getting their point across; this is why Gemini make great salespeople or politicians. They are great at manipulating words to their advantage or amusement. Gemini are very good judge of character, although they do not go into depth of character. They are great at multi-tasking and will often do many things at once. They are very agile with their hands and fingers. Their strengths can potentially turn into weaknesses such as: restlessness, shallowness, evasiveness, unreliability, and self-delusion. Gemini sometimes suffer from severe anxiety when they takes on more than they can handle; especially if the mortal twin is active. Gemini are known to be cold-hearted since emotions are too restricting for their fast-paced, analytical mind. They are still very kind and generous people and have a tendency to go out of their way to help someone in need. Their quick-to-analyze policy sometimes renders them to become shallow because they don't take the time to explore in depth the issue/person that is in front of them.</p>

				<h2><i>Likes / Hobbies</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini love their comfort and sensuality and everything that provides these for them. Soothing music and comfortable clothes that make them look good are very popular with Gemini.  They love food, especially fatty foods like steak, chocolates, and creams.  Gemini' love for food is both physical and spiritual: food makes them feel so good both emotionally and physically.  Gemini love their homes and love to furnish them with their possessions, which are usually very big in size. They love to be surrounded by their possessions and the people who appreciate them because that gives them assurance.  Gemini love to be touched and caressed softly.  They work hard and like their peace and quiet time, so please, just give them some and understand.  Gemini like to collect wealth and be financially stable, then use this money to buy themselves more comfort and pleasure.  Gemini love nature and earth and have a longing to live somewhere pastoral and natural; like a farm, for instance.</p>

				<h2><i>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini hate fast changes and starting things over again.  They hate irresponsibility, dishonesty, disloyalty, and wasting energy for no reason.  Gemini usually dislike loud-mouthed people that talk a lot. They believe that rules were made to protect everyone and ensure stability and therefore hate breaking the rules and causing trouble or people who do so constantly.  Gemini hate being bossed around or controlled (even though they might do so themselves).  They hate being disturbed during their quiet time and the act of someone invading their "territory" can drive them mad. Gemini is very territorial and keeps a vigilant watch over their "space", loved ones, and properties. </p>

				<h2><i>How to Approach an Gemini</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini are naturally mistrusting and careful of others. Therefore one must approach a Gemini gently, making sure not to overstep one's boundary by asking personal questions that revolve around his intimate matters of life such as his love life, his financial matters, etc. Loud talking and public spectacles are also a wrong way to approach the quiet, calm Gemini. Although they show little or no emotions, they are very sensitive and their feelings can be easily hurt. Therefore one must chose their words carefully when speaking to a Gemini about personal matters. Trust is extremely important to them because it resonates with their need for stability. If Gemini deem someone deceitful or incompetent, that person has a very small chance of regaining their trust. Once one has gained the trust and favor of a Gemini, one will find them to be a very honest, caring, and dependable friend. Gemini like to be touched by their loved ones and communicates a lot through touch. One must be aware of the Gemini' tendency to control their surroundings and the people that surround them. Their intentions are purely helpful and not to be disrespected. If one is experiencing difficulty with this or any other of their behaviors, one must make sure to tell them in a gentle manner. A soft touch, compassionate eyes, friendly smile, and a polite request can achieve almost anything with a Gemini. Anger, arguments, blame, criticism etc. will result in Gemini becoming very stubborn and defensive. Gemini rarely argues their point or way, they just does what they feels is right and disregard the rest.</p>

				<h2><i>Relationship Aspirations</i></h2>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini are motivated fully by their need to give and receive physical stability and security. They do not have a true sense of themselves until they connect themselves to their surrounding and their close relationships. Gemini do so by providing their loved ones with physical security such as protection, food, finance, etc. in a hope that they will be treated well in return. Gemini are very easily hurt emotionally and want someone who will be gentle with their feelings. They also want someone that they can provide for and call their "own", thus connecting to him/her. Since Gemini seek to gain stability, it is very likely that a female Gemini will want someone with a solid job and financial stability. The male Gemini will look for someone who can care for him on a more physical level such as cooking, cleaning, etc. Both sexes will like someone who is outgoing and independent yet will stay away from loud and out of control individuals or ones that are promiscuous/not trustworthy. Both sexes like a strong minded mate yet would like to maintain control at all times. Someone sensual like them is a big plus. Gemini usually do not initiate the first move in relationships; they wait for the right opportunity.  </p>
