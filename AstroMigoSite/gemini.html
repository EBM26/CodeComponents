				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">G</span>emini is the Mutable stage of the Air element and is ruled by the lunar side of Mercury. This means that they use Mercury's energy of highlighting differences in order to convert (Mutable stage) ideas and communications (Air element) into new concepts.</p>
					<p>The energy of Mercury does not have long term influence. It highlights the difference between two or more things/concepts, which then become part of the establishment, and then it moves to something new. Gemini act the same way: they contrast between two things/ideas/words/people/etc., distinguish the difference between them and thus define them, then quickly move to the next item. The Mutable stage is what makes Gemini flexible, love change, be complex, be highly adaptable, and very resourceful. The Air element is what makes them great communicators, analytical, curious, intellectual, social, detached, and easy flowing.</p>

				<img src="images/gemini-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini's symbol is two twins. The word gemini is translated from the Latin word didymoi, which means "the twins". Sources attribute them to being Castor and Pollux, the famous twins from Greek Mythology. Both born to a mortal mother, Pollux was the son of Zeus and thus immortal. Castor was the son of a mortal father and thus mortal. They took part in many heroic adventures together until Castor's inevitable death. Pollux begged his father, Zeus, to let him die with Castor so that they will be together in death as they were in life. Zeus decided to let them be together in life by allowing Castor to share in Pollux's immortality and eternal life while Pollux had to share in Castor's mortality and potential death.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">This is the reason that many people mistake Gemini to have a split personality while in reality they just have many perspectives.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>The twin symbolism is represented in Gemini by his duality of thought and ideals, always seeing two sides of every concept, thing, and issue. This is the reason that many people mistake Gemini to have a split personality while in reality they just have many perspectives. Since the Greek twins were mortal and immortal, Gemini also have those two sides to them. At times, they are arrogant, cocky, and fearless like an immortal; other times they are scared, nervous, and timid as a mortal.</p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini represent the "Child" or "Childhood" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. No longer needing to scream or wait patiently to receive what they need as they did in the earlier Aries and Taurus stages, the child-like Gemini soul have learned to use its uncanny communication abilities to ask for what they need and lean from others. This is also the stage in human development when mental capabilities are developed, which is why Gemini's greatest strength is their mind.</p>  
					<p>Just like a child, Gemini are very curious and want to explore everything around them. They have a child-like joy and excitement to them and are also saddened by the hardships of discipline and responsibility which limit their freedom of fun and exploration. In this karmic stage, the soul becomes aware of its surroundings and the differences between themselves and the people around them. And thus, Gemini love to meet new people so they can compare and contrast themselves to others, which makes them develop very sharp social skills. Their life mantra is "I think". They came to teach that "love is awareness" and to learn that "love is emotion" since their cold, calculated thinking leaves little room for emotions.</p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Gemini</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini usually have a tall, narrow body. Their bodies are quite well-balanced in both upper and lower sections. The most distinguished features of a Gemini are that they talks constantly about everything and anything, making many fast hand gestures while doing so. Their eyes are very playful and constantly move from one location to the next; never resting on one object for more than a couple of seconds. Gemini very friendly, smiley, and joyful. Their curiosity gives them away as they asks many questions while they try to wrap their analytical mind around the person they are talking to. Their movements are very light, quick, and swift; almost like humming bird.</p>

				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini's strong traits are: versatility, mental alertness, quick-perception, flexibility, logical thinking, and great communication abilities. Gemini are said to be able to read and understand everything, and from here lies their talent for different languages. Their mind is very sharp; they understands and learns new things at a very fast pace.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Gemini's ability to see two sides of every concept/situation makes them very good at cataloging, categorizing, defining, and qualifying things/people/concepts/etc.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Gemini's ability to see two sides of every concept/situation makes them very good at cataloging, categorizing, defining, and qualifying things/people/concepts/etc. They are a master of persuasion and getting their point across; this is why Gemini make great salespeople or politicians. They are great at manipulating words to their advantage or amusement. Gemini are very good judge of character, although they do not go into depth of character. They are great at multi-tasking and will often do many things at once. They are very agile with their hands and fingers.</p> 
					<p>Their strengths can potentially turn into weaknesses such as: restlessness, shallowness, evasiveness, unreliability, and self-delusion. Gemini sometimes suffer from severe anxiety when they takes on more than they can handle; especially if the mortal twin is active. Gemini are known to be cold-hearted since emotions are too restricting for their fast-paced, analytical mind. They are still very kind and generous people and have a tendency to go out of their way to help someone in need. Their quick-to-analyze policy sometimes renders them to become shallow because they don't take the time to explore in depth the issue/person that is in front of them.</p>

				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Just as Gemini minds move very fast, so does their attention on the current subject they are putting effort into. In the beginning, they will find a subject/matter/person highly interesting and will put a lot of mental effort and time into it. As time progresses, their excitement dies down and/or they stumbles across something more interesting (which happens very often). They will then abandon that interest completely and divert their full attention towards their new interest. This results in Gemini having many unfinished, brilliant ideas that could help their lives if only they would complete them. A good advice would be for them to partner up with someone more stable (like a Taurus or a Virgo) in order to make sure the project is finished or have a third party with a strong influence on them keep tabs on the progress.</p> 
					<p>Gemini curiosity leads them to explore and understand many new, useful, and interesting things in life. It also can lead them to dangerous grounds and harmful decisions. Their hasty movements and thirsty curiosity can lead them to visit a dangerous place, trust in strangers, leave profitable positions, etc. A good advice would be for them to weigh their decisions carefully, perhaps with the aid of a third party. Gemini have an uncanny talent to manipulate words and concepts. This may lead to other people perceiving them as deceitful or two-faced. The truth is, Gemini naturally see many sides to every coin and that is how they actually think. A good advice would be for them to be careful on how they word their thoughts with those who have simpler minds than them, and maybe sometimes "dumb down" the way they talk.</p> 
					<p>Gemini have a tendency to take on more than they can handle sometimes. When that happens, their fear and anxiety levels shoot up high as their restless mind conjures up endless worst-case scenarios of what could happen if they fail their tasks. It is no wonder that many Gemini suffer from sleepless nights. A good advice would be to consider carefully how much they can handle at once, get a like-minded, quick-witted assistant if needed, and meditate often to sooth that over-worked mental machine of his.</p>

			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini enjoy activities that are fast-paced, diverse, interesting, and give their mind a good workout. They also would like to exercise their other talent while doing things; communicating with others. Therefore, the racket sports such as: tennis, badminton, etc. are often Gemini's favorite sport. They allow them to be light on their feet, move constantly, and engage in a friendly conversation with their opponent while playing. Gemini love board games, especially those that challenge their thinking skills. They love to exercise their writing skills and will often have a column, blog, book, etc. that they are writing on the side if they aren't doing that already for a living.</p> 
					<p>Another fun past-time of Gemini is tinkering with inventions, electronics, gadgets, etc. that require minimum physical effort and maximum mental effort. Gemini are not big foodies and will sometimes forget to eat if they are engulfed in nourishing their intellectual hunger. When they do eat, they like to have variety in their foods and eat light foods that don't weigh them down. Gemini are not particular about clothing. They prefer the lighter colors such as yellow, blue, pink, etc. and clothes that allow them freedom of movement. Gemini have a favorite weakness; gambling. The rush of the unknown and the possibility to make a large sum of money with minimum effort enchants them greatly. Gemini absolutely love to travel and have endless dreams of exploring the whole world, different cultures, and new people.</p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini's biggest dislike in this world is feeling tied down to anything for a long time, especially if that thing is boring or lacks variety. Gemini's mind works at a very fast pace and so they get bored quickly with something they have already done or someone they have already spent time with. Gemini need the freedom and possibility to engage their minds with constant new objects/people/ideas/etc.</p> 
					<p>Being in a position that they feel restricted by someone or something stifles them and brings them down. Boredom is Gemini's enemy, and so is being tied down to static, daily responsibilities. Gemini love to play on words and often playfully say random things. This can be fun and entertaining if taken lightly. If taken literally, though, it can mean trouble. Therefore Gemini dislikes being around people who take their words too seriously or are not playful. </p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach an Gemini</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini love to meet new people and engage in conversations; they does so in a quick manner, both physically and mentally. For these reasons, Gemini are more likely to introduce themselves to you before you even have a chance of spotting them in the room. They will swiftly and stealthily land next to you like a humming bird on a flower, and then make a witty remark or observation about something to you. This will result in a long conversation and them asking many questions in order to mentally grasp the new person they just met and evaluate whether this person is interesting enough to spend more time with. Occasionally, Gemini will engage in a long conversation with a person they is not particularly fond of just for the sake of talking. This happens due to Gemini's need to form their numerous ideas into words and they need an audience for that. In return for your listening ear, they will provide you with new information and perspectives that they have thought up. Gemini also enjoy it when the people who are listening to them provide their own, different, intellectual perspective on the subject at hand so that they can compare and contrast with the info/opinion they have in order to form a final, refined opinion.</p> 
					<p>Gemini are not in any need of honor, support, favor, or understanding. All they want is a mentally stimulating, adventurous, fun companion that they can occasionally engage in conversation, travel with, or just have fun with. If you want Gemini to like you and spend more time with you, all you need to do is sharpen your wits, be up-to-date with the latest news/gadgets/events, and be interesting and intriguing enough to keep them curious. With all that in mind, you should note a few important matters about having a relationship with a Gemini: First, Gemini have a lot of friends who enjoy their company and they like to rotate between all of them so that they can be updated as much as possible with all of them and have a large variety in their companionship. Second, Gemini are not one to be ordered around or restricted by any means; this includes heavy emotional involvement.</p> 
					<p>Gemini are too light and versatile to be tied down to any particular emotion for a long time and are often thought of as cold-hearted. Therefore, they are not a friend you should call in emotional distress or expect to have around you all the time. Just be grateful for the time they spend with you and consult them in what he's great at; contrasting ideas and providing new information or perspectives. Third, Gemini decide to do things very quickly. The problem is that this decision might change just as quickly and so Gemini are known to be "flaky" people. The truth is, they really meant it when they said yes, it's just that something else grabbed their attention. Again, Gemini are not a friend to be tied down or called upon with an important, long term responsibility. If you understand and incorporate these concepts, you will find Gemini to be very fun and entertaining companions. No use lying to these friends; their sharp, perceptive mind can see through lies quickly and generally have a great talent of understanding the people and situations in front of them. They won't hold it against you if you do decide to try to lie to them; fights, arguments, battles of pride, etc. do not concern Gemini at all.</p> 
					<p>Since Gemini is made of a set of twins, you might find that your companion's character might change from time to time. At times they will embody the haughty, fun-loving, social, adventurous twin. Other times they will embody the nervous, shy, cautious, evasive twin. Don't worry, this is perfectly normal. Gemini have wild imaginations that are fueled by their restless minds and often say and plan things they don't really have the intention of doing. Gemini also like to cover their tracks and elude others about their intentions or plans; it is a way for them to ensure their freedom. </p>

				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Gemini are in search of relationships with partners that are fun, adventurous, intelligent, diverse, easy-going, and fast-paced. They are not looking for someone who is too serious and especially not for relationships that involve intense emotional investments. This ideal mate needs to be someone who will always be available to ward off the loneliness Gemini so very fears yet not be dependent on Gemini always being there for him/her. This mate needs to understand the free-spirited, hyper-active mind that hides behind Gemini's playful eyes and provide them with diverse entertainment, intellectual stimulation, new adventures, and the freedom to explore on their own when they need it.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left"> This ideal mate needs to be someone who will always be available to ward off the loneliness Gemini so very fears yet not be dependent on Gemini always being there for him/her.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Gemini are also in need of someone with a grounded manner who can take care of them physically, provide some stability, and provide the safety they need when they gets into a state of anxiety or fear. This mate needs to understand that Gemini's mutable character changes have nothing to do with him/her. Gemini is not one to turn away from another person's smile; be it man, woman, or child. They are naturally playful and social. The opposite sex is often charmed by them and they have many admirers. Nevertheless, if Gemini's mate gives them trust, faith, belief, and freedom, they will not betray him/her.</p>
