				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">L</span>ibra is the Cardinal stage of the Air Element that is ruled by the solar side of Venus. This means that they use Venus energy of bringing things that are similar together and catalyze (Cardinal stage) relationships, communication, and ideas (Air element). It is the energy of Venus that makes them charming, love being around people, love music, love art and beauty. The Cardinal stage makes them love sparking new relationships and leading others into new ideas/ventures. The Air Element is what makes them so intelligent, great communicators, easy flowing, and great thinkers. Libra's general focus in life is achieving balance in all aspects of their lives, going through stages of extremities until finally reaching the coveted equilibrium.</p>

				<img src="images/libra-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>The Libra symbol is a blindfolded woman holding a scale. The blindfold represents that justice is blind and that is why Libra are so motivated to bring justice and fairness to the world. It also symbolizes that love is blind, noting to Libra's addiction to love and romance. The scales represent Libra's never ending struggle for achieving balance that goes through the path of the scales tipping from one extreme to the other in an effort to balance themselves. This represents Libra's often seesawing from one extreme to the other in their lives.</p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra is the "Marriage" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. Right after the lonely and selfish stage of Virgo, the soul wants to have as many connections as possible in order to share the beauty it sees in life. This attributes to Libra's love of making new connections, use of charm to be liked by others, and judging people with fairness. Their mantra in life is "I balance". They came to teach that "love is beauty" and came to learn that "love is harmony". Their karmic goal is to achieve harmony and balance in life.</p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Libra</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra bodies and faces are like their life goal; balanced. Slim, yet with enough curves not to be angular. Their faces and complexions are fair. Their body moves with grace. One distinguishable mark Libra have are the dimples on their faces, either in their cheeks or in the middle of their chins. Their manner is usually delicate and tactful with much grace. Although, since they bounce from one extreme to the other, it is common to see them in a loud argument or aggressive manner of some sort.</p>

			<div class="info-box mid-box">
				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra possess an extreme sense of justice and fairness, are very understanding, charming, delicate, and emotionally balanced (once they have reached that point).  They are masters of communication and contact with others.  They are a masters in planning things out and are often victorious because of their keen ability to see both sides of the coin properly and thus plan according to all sides.</p>
					<p> Libra's potential weaknesses can be laziness, indecision, argumentativeness, lustfulness, and ill-tempered.  They cannot stand to be alone.  In their journey for balance, they sometimes fall into a weak spot of over-indulgence and lust.  They need time to make decisions, constantly debating themselves and changing their decisions even over the simplest of matters.  They cannot stand the thought of being unfair to someone and to them it is as bad as murder.  They are weak in retrospective and needs someone to point out and help them realize what's really going on in their life.</p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>His life long journey for balance can help him perfect many aspects in his life. Along the way, he might fall into a weak spot of over-indulgence and lust. His talent for weighing all his options can help him be a master planner and strategist in everything he does. The same trait can lead into indecisiveness and second guessing of himself. His addiction to romance and immense need to be with someone might lead him into rush and harmful decisions or journeys.</p>

				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra love music.  They enjoy the reality of being in a relationship and having a connection with someone regardless of how well or beneficial the relationship is.  They love to argue even if it's just for the sake of arguing.  They like to defend the other side of the argument even if they don't believe in it completely and especially if they believe in the cause/person or feel that they are defenseless.  They like protecting the weak for the sake of justice.  They like bright colors more than dark colors, and usually dresses very elegantly.</p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>	Libra hates being rushed to make decision.  Hates being unfair or witnessing an injustice.  Hates doing things alone or being alone. Hates to lose. </p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Libra</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra love connecting with people and so approaching one is a very easy task. Although they usually wait for the right moment to approach someone, if you take the initiative, you will find that the Libra is more than welcoming towards you. Do not expect a very long lasting relationship, if you cannot provide the excitement and interest the Libra seek, they might just add you to the list of countless people they have met and lost interest in.</p> 
					<p>Libra are known to not show up to a place or event they RSVP'd to. Nothing personal, they just forgot or found something more interesting. Libra are naturally strong willed leaders but will follow your path if you can logically persuade them that your way makes more sense. Do not mistake Libra to be indecisive or try to rush them into making up their minds. Libras take their time to decide and when they have reached a decision, it is almost impossible to move them from it. You will find that Libra will often judge you and your actions out loud. Their intentions are solely to try and help you balance yourself out.</p>

				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Libra love romance and want a mate who will be charming and romantic like they are. They have been known to jump from one mate to another due to their difficulty in remaining interested in one person/idea/thing for a long time and believe that the next person will be more interesting. The ideal mate for them would be one that can maintain mysteriousness or excitement for an infinite amount of time. They like someone who is classy and elegant like they are. They appreciate beauty and so would like for their mates to be good looking and well groomed. They are very intellectual and love arguing, therefore they want someone that can challenge their intellect and provide a stimulant conversation/argument.</p>
