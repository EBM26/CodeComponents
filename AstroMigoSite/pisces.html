				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">P</span>isces is the Mutable stage of the Water element and is ruled by the lunar side of Jupiter. This means that Pisces use Jupiter's powers of knowledge and imagination in order convert (Mutable stage) individual emotions (Water element) that are impressed on them into one single entity. Up until Pisces, the Zodiac began with individuality and broadened its social circle with each sign; going from the individual beginnings represented by Aries, then widening the circle of friends, family, groups, and nations until the forming of large ideologies represented by Aquarius. Pisces is the sign that incorporates all the emotions, experiences, strengths, etc. of all the other 11 signs in the Zodiac.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Anything is possible in the world of Pisces but nothing is defined. Their world is not only limitless, but also shapeless.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Pisces exist in the past, present, and future all at the same time. Anything is possible in the world of Pisces but nothing is defined. Their world is not only limitless, but also shapeless. The best analogy to describe Pisces is to look at a new package of multi-colored clay. In the beginning, all the colors are clearly defined and individual. By the time a child has played with it and mashed it up, all the colors are mixed into one solid color that consists of all the other colors. The Water element is what makes Pisces intuitive, nurturing, compassionate, imaginative, and sensitive. The Mutable stage is what makes Pisces flexible, complex, adaptable, resourceful, and love change.</p>

				<img src="images/pisces-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces' symbol is a pair of fish that are attached together by each others' tails to their reciprocal mouths. This is represented in Pisces in the fact that they "go with the flow" and swim in the sea of emotions and imagination just like a fish swims in water. The pair of fish (instead of just one) represent the duality of Pisces who alternates between reality and fiction, conscious thinking and an unconscious, dream-like state; a sort of ying-yang sensibility.</p> 
					<p>The pair of fish also symbolizes the two choices ahead of Pisces' lives; to rise up and swim to the top or to sink down and never reach their life purpose. Just like a fish, Pisces is vulnerable to those who wish to take advantage of their kind, giving nature. Their only defenses are either swimming away or making themselves invisible like a coy fish does. </p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces represents the "Ancient Soul" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. It is the last stop in the Zodiac train, so to speak, the final stage the soul has to go through. Anyone who has reached the stage of Pisces has already gone through all the other 11 signs. In this stage, the soul has come to learn all the important lessons that she has to learn yet failed to do so in her last 11 stages. Therefore, Pisces is also equipped with the knowledge and the potential strengths of all the other 11 signs.</p> 
					<p>This is by far the most complex stage of all. Chances are that anyone who is a Pisces will not succeed to learn all their lessons during their first time; barring some very "advanced" souls who chose to come back in order to help other lost souls. Having gone through all the other stages, the Pisces soul feel sympathy towards and understand the other signs of the Zodiac.</p> 
					<p>The Pisces soul acts like a blank film; absorbing all the emotional impressions of a person, idea, object, etc. and resembling it so well that it is impossible to tell the difference between Pisces and what they absorbed. This is the reason Pisces is called the "Chameleon of the Zodiac". Their life mantra is "I believe", for Pisces believes that pain and suffering aren't a part of the ultimate divine plan and that mankind must be unified and taught a higher purpose. Pisces came to teach that "love is compassion" and to learn that "love is EVERYTHING"; Pisces' biggest challenge in life is how to absorb everything yet not lose themselves in the process.</p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Pisces</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces usually have a medium to short height; seldom tall. Pisces' weight is usually shifted to the lower part of their body; most commonly their legs. Their most distinguished feature is the lack of firmness in their body frame; as if the very thing that stiffens everybody else's body is missing from them. Their eyes are watery, accompanied by heavy eye-lashes, and full of light; Pisces are known to have beautiful eyes, the mirrors to their beautiful souls.</p> 
					<p>They have a floating walk; as if they just swim around when they walk. Pisces usually hang their head low when they walk. Pisces are quite the talkers and the intellectuals. Add to that their aspiration towards a better mankind and prominent spirituality and what you get is someone who is usually talking or arguing about humanitarian matters or at some rally or protest. </p>

				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces' strong traits are: humility, compassion, sensitivity, spiritual awareness, supernatural intuition, philosophical wisdom, and a special skill to heal people. In their strong state, Pisces knows exactly what they came into this world for, what they need to fix, and the tools/skills/powers they need to use to accomplish this life mission. Since Pisces are the last sign of the Zodiac, they have the ability to draw upon any strong feature that is found in any of the other 11 signs of the Zodiac. Pisces are also master shape-shifters, able to play the role of anyone they wish.</p> 
					<p>Pisces love and excel in all forms of artistic expressions due to their very sensitive manner. There are absolutely no boundaries to this sign's artistic abilities. What actually happens is that Pisces accurately define the feelings of a certain object/view/picture/person/etc. through their sensitivity, and then use their uncanny imaginative powers to express them on a canvas, dance floor, statue, musical instrument, etc. Pisces' lack of greed, pride, inflated ego, and stubbornness allows them to flow easily through life and avoid conflicts with others. Pisces are peaceful, calm, and non-violent. They are masters of humor and satire; sarcasm flows readily from this fish. Pisces are blessed with the sensitivity, knowledge, humility, and patience to understand anyone, from a simple person to a mass murderer. They never approach the task of understanding someone with any prejudice. </p>

There are absolutely no boundaries to this sign's artistic abilities.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>The potential weaknesses of Pisces are: cowardice, timidity, masochism, laziness, weak-willed, and an inclination to lie. Pisces are sensitive to others' hurtful remarks. Their very kind and non-aggressive manner also makes them an easy target for those who wish to take advantage of them. Pisces' number one weakness in life is the potential to float lazily through life without accomplishing much. It's very easy for them to live in a dream state and allow themselves to believe that they are advancing towards their ultimate goal while in reality they aren't even in the right direction.</p> 
					<p>Pisces are not grounded people and therefore sometimes forget to attend to their worldly needs and responsibilities; a weakness that often causes them physical harm. Even though all the Water signs posses an inclination towards substance abuse, Pisces are known to be even more inclined; alcohol and Pisces have a special bond. Pisces' dreams of a perfect world are shattered when they see evil or malice and their high sensitivity cause them to have a dire need to mentally and emotionally escape. In the best case, this happens through their wild imagination; in the worst, through alcohol or drugs. </p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces are very big lover of fish and everything else that comes from the sea. Liquid-based foods are also a favorite of theirs and so are foods with smooth textures. Pisces are also big fans of alcohol; it changes and intensifies their emotions. Pisces are usually not particularly athletic and for sure not competitive. Therefore, the sports Pisces enjoy are more on the artistic, solo side. Pisces enjoy swimming, dancing, fishing, and all other water sports. Their other hobbies usually have something to do with pictures; capturing their essence, feeling, and precise vision. Filming and photography are big on their list; so is going to the movies.</p> 
					<p>As for clothing, Pisces can wear and look great in practically anything. In Pisces' case, the clothes literally "make the man". Pisces are influenced greatly by what they wear and their behavior and mood will change according to what they wear. Since Pisces' associated body part are the feet, they are infatuated with shoes and possesses many different pairs. Pisces also have a strange hobby to fool people. It is usually harmless, insignificant foolery, yet highly entertaining to this fish. If Pisces have succeeded in fooling someone that the sky is green colored when it is actually blue, they would be greatly pleased.</p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Pisces, like his symbol, hates being constricted to one place or task; he likes variety and mobility. Pisces dislikes being around people who are mean-spirited, aggressive, shallow, or have little imagination. Pisces dislikes seeing cruelty, hurt, pain, or suffering of any kind. (RE-WRITE THIS)</p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Pisces</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Everyone looks for something specific out of a friendship. For Pisces, this concept revolves around two important matters that possess the same root. The first thing that Pisces look for in a friendship is an emotional response from their new acquaintance; anger, fear, sadness, excitement, or any other emotion that Pisces can feed off and arouses their imagination. For this reason you might see Pisces hang around loud, extravagant people. This is also the reason Pisces find it hard to be tied down to just one friend; they need a variety of fluctuating emotions that one person cannot provide.</p> 
					<p>The second thing Pisces looks for in a new friendship is the need for assistance. People who are going through a hard period of time, are addicted to substances, or are just down on their luck. The harder the case, the more Pisces feel compelled to befriend this person; even if this person is rude and disrespectful towards Pisces in return. Pisces love to help and be of servitude. But the underlying reason for this fascination with the needy is the emotional responses they provide Pisces, just like the first reason.</p> 
					<p>In Pisces you will find a friend who is nice, accommodating, easy going, goes with the flow, humble, and adventurous. You will find that your friend the Pisces will mimic your favorite hobby and become vastly knowledgeable in it within a short amount of time. When they will tire from it, they will seek out a different adventure. However, do not expect your new friend to be one who is always reliable, responsible, or on time; Pisces sometimes wonders off into their own version of reality and forgets their other arrangements.</p>
					<p>Whatever you say to them, make sure you are sensitive. If Pisces are in a bad mood, they expresses it passive-aggressively with witty and satirical remarks that can be hurtful. Pisces enjoy fooling people with small, insignificant trickeries. You will be wise to pretend you were fooled in order to amuse them and put their mischievous mind to rest. </p>

				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p> Pisces are hopeless romantics by nature. When Pisces fall in love, it is usually a loud and colorful event. Pisces fall in love with the person who can create such a special feeling within them that they cannot get enough of; it doesn't necessarily have to be the feeling of love. Within the relationship, Pisces prefer to be on the giving end rather than the receiving end. Pisces bring with them their very sensitive and understanding manner which they use to understand their mate and comfort him/her in times of need. Pisces themselves, however, are hard to read.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Pisces fall in love with the person who can create such a special feeling within them that they cannot get enough of; it doesn't necessarily have to be the feeling of love.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p> 
					<p>The male Pisces is charming and charismatic; he is able to paint a dream inside any woman's head and cause her to fall in love with him. However, the Pisces male has a difficult time staying with one woman for the rest of his life; he begins to feel constricted after a while. His mate will be wise to provide the variety emotions and experience he longs for. The Pisces male also looks for a mate who provides him with emotional support and pushes him to accomplish his dreams.</p> 
					<p>The female Pisces is the embodiment of the fair, charming, feminine, damsel in distress. She is quite sought after by many men due to her humble, sweet, accommodating manner; never demanding or pressing her man for much. In her eyes, her man can overcome any obstacle in the world and she is willing to do anything for him. All the Pisces woman asks in return is for her man to protect and take care of her. In a low circumstance, this defenseless damsel has to the power to become deceitful and manipulative; the Pisces woman can wrap almost any man around her finger and make him do anything. </p>
