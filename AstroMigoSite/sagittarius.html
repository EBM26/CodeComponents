				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">S</span>agittarius is the Mutable stage of the Fire Element and is ruled by the solar side of Jupiter. This means that they use Jupiter's energy of expanding intellectually to learn as much knowledge as they can so that they can convert (Mutable) those ideas into actions (Fire Element). It is the expanding influence of Jupiter that makes them seek out new knowledge, explore lands, cultures, and people. The Mutable stage is what makes them flexible, love change, be emotionally/mentally complex, be highly adaptable, and very resourceful. The Fire Element is what makes them love action, be passionate about what they love, be very warm, be quick to get angry and quick to calm down.</p>

				<img src="images/sagittarius-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>The Sagittarius symbol is a Centaur, which is a mythological creature that is a horse from the waist down and a human from the waist up, and is holding a drawn bow and arrow. The bottom part of the Sagittarius is what makes the Sagittarius very mobile, jumpy, athletic, beast-like, and playful just like a horse. The top human part is what makes them intellectual, communicative, and love people. The drawn bow and arrow represent the arrows of truth, knowledge, and curiosity that the Sagittarius are so ready to shoot towards other people or the universe in order to achieve their ever long quest for truth. </p>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius is the "Middle Ages" or "Mid-Life" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. This is represented by their need to find depth and truth in their lives before they die, sort of like a mid-life crisis. Included in this is their deep need to throw away the shackles of life and responsibility in order to venture into the unknown while having as much wild fun as they can.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Sagittarius feel the need to enjoy and explore life as much as possible, which leaves no time for petty things such as tact, manners, or any other obstacles that might come up.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p> 
					<p>This metaphorical stage causes them to be hasty and impatient in life, feeling that death is around the corner. Sagittarius feel the need to enjoy and explore life as much as possible, which leaves no time for petty things such as tact, manners, or any other obstacles that might come up. Their main mantra in life is "I See". they came to teach that "love is honesty" and to learn that "love is loyalty"; their hardest challenge in life is staying tied down to one place/person/idea etc.</p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Sagittarius</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius usually have a medium to tall height, occasionally very tall. They have been known to have long limbs, especially the legs. Very athletically built. Rarely will you meet an overweight Sagittarius since they are always on the move and burning fat. They are known to have long faces, especially a big head and tall forehead which is their most distinguished feature.</p> 
					<p>Sagittarius move their hands very fast and clumsily, are accident prone, and sometimes knock over things while trying to demonstrate something with their hand gestures. Their eyes are shiny, awake, and playful. Their behavior is usually loud and noticeable. They are always on the move and they move very fast. They will say tactless, hurtful things to people's faces without notice and don't understand that their mouths are too loose for people to handle. </p>

				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius' main strengths are openness, gaiety, rationality, integrity, daringness, and excitement. They are very optimistic to the point that they see the positive side in everything and therefore possess incredible luck and fortune. They are confident they can solve any problem and are invincible. They are not afraid of anyone and therefore allow themselves to be honest to everyone all the time including themselves. They are very loyal to their partners even though they are often mistaken to be promiscuous.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Sagittarius are very loyal to their partners even though they are often mistaken to be promiscuous.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>Sagittarius' potential weaknesses are: recklessness, impatience, emotional perplexity, tactless, vulgarity, and instability.  They are very curious and fear to miss out on things. They are naturally clumsy and hurt themselves often. They have a difficulty respecting authority or people who want to be honored. They are very sarcastic and are clueless that their in-your-face, truthful way of speaking hurts people's feelings. In their minds, Sagittarius think they are very soft and diplomatic. In reality, their impulsive and vulgar manner causes them to say or do things first and then regret and ask for forgiveness later.</p> 
					<p>They do not like to be tied down to relationships and their responsibilities. They have a need to be in constant movement and might get ill if they stop for a long time. They have an awful short term memory; they can remember exactly what they did this day 40 years ago but not where they left their keys, hat, jacket, hat, etc.</p>

				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius have a very optimistic view on life and are very physically, emotionally, and mentally resilient and therefore not many things in life harm them or create problems they can't handle. Their curious outlook on life and their need for new adventures often lead them down rabbit holes that are dangerous. Again, nothing they can't usually handle.</p> 
					<p>The only two habits they should be aware of that may bring them possible harm are: 1. Their deep need to explore new adventures may harm the more stable aspects of life such as marriage, career, etc. They therefore should be in an environment that accommodates their need of freedom such as a flexible profession, and understanding spouse, etc.</p> 
					<p>2. Their deep-rooted habit of saying non-filtered things to people's faces may hurt the feelings of the people around them or get them into trouble. They should surround themselves with people who don't get hurt easily, or they should make an attempt to warn others of their habit.</p>

				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius love to travel. They enjoy the actual travel more than the destination itself. They love to discover new lands and people. They love sports that require a lot of movement. They have a very big sexual appetite and love sex. Sagittarius like to argue for the sake of truth. They love animals. They are very drawn to religion and the quest for perfect ideals. They like the color blue since it represents calmness. They love to play challenging games. They love to gamble and the thrill of danger. They love showbiz and the entertainment industry.</p> 
					<p>Sagittarius' taste in food is simple and they are always hungry since they are always on the move and exerting energy. They like to wear clothes that give them freedom of movement. They do not know what to wear since they are always changing places and events. They like to have a collection of antiques from their travels and books for their intellect.</p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius cannot stand a perversion of truth. Anything untrue in their eyes will be challenged by them even in the expense of hurting or embarrassing the person who said it. They absolutely hate being called dishonest or a liar. They strongly dislike being told what to do, conformity, hierarchy, and establishments. Even clothes that set boundaries on them are disliked. Other than that, Sagittarius are usually very easy to get along with and there isn't much that gets under their skin.</p>

				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Sagittarius</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Sagittarius have a loose mouth and tend to say things that can be considered hurtful straight to people's faces. Therefore one must be aware that Sagittarius have no malice intentions when doing so and are totally unaware of the hurt they cause. It's just their habit of saying the truth with no filter. Sagittarius are very active and curious and therefore tend to get bored of people or situations quite quickly. If you want to keep a Sagittarius around yourself for a long time, you must be interesting, spontaneous, mysterious, etc.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless, one must be aware that the Sagittarius has no owners or much feeling of obligation towards others. They feel free to go wherever and do whatever they want. Accepting this freedom is essential if one wants to cultivate a relationship with Sagittarius.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Do not mistake their positive, happy, rugged exterior for someone that is rugged inside as well; Sagittarius is one of the most sensitive signs.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p>
					<p>They are a Fire sign, so that means their temper is easy to flare up and easy to calm down. Sagittarius have very little respect or patience for authority or authority figures, so it's unwise to approach a Sagittarius from a point of authority. Don't bother giving Sagittarius your advice, they believe no one to be wiser than him. Another important thing to remember about Sagittarius is that they are VERY sensitive. Do not mistake their positive, happy, rugged exterior for someone that is rugged inside as well; Sagittarius is one of the most sensitive signs.</p>

				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>In general, Sagittarius are wary about long lasting relationships, let alone marriage. The thought of these freedom lovers being constricted to one person for the rest of their lives scares them; especially the males which are known to bounce around from mate to mate. He never plays with their emotions, though, he makes it quite clear from the beginning that this is a temporary situation.</p> 
					<p>The female Sagittarius are a bit more fragile. Even though they are tough and often tomboyish, their hearts are soft and get hurt easily. The person that will be able to tie the knot with a Sagittarius will have to be someone that is able to give them their utmost freedom without getting worried, jealous, or lonely. That person also must be someone who can take care of themselves and not needy of constant attention. Being interesting, mysterious, and hard to get is another must. Sagittarius are huge fans of philosophy and intellect and thus appreciates a mate with the same capabilities. Being that Sagittarius is always on the move and often a sporty person, a mobile mate is a big plus with them.</p>
