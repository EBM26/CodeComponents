				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p><span class="big-letter">V</span>irgo is the Mutable stage of the Earth element and is ruled by the solar side of Mercury. This means that Virgo use Mercury's energy of highlighting differences in order to convert (Mutable stage) materials (Earth element) into more efficient ones. In a practical sense, when Virgo want to accomplish a task or create something, they first use their uncanny discerning and analytical abilities in order to break down the task or object in front of them into tiny details. Once Virgo have understood all of it, which usually does not take long since their mind is very quick, Virgo begins to form a technique that will be the most efficient and practical way of accomplishing the task or creating the new object.</p> 
					<p>If this project involves other people, Virgo will use their great communication skills to convey what they have learned to others so that they may also accomplish their task in the most efficient way possible; their way. The Mutable stage is what makes Virgo highly adaptable, resourceful, and like new experiences. However, since Virgo is an Earth sign, the stubborn, rigid, stable, earthly influences separate them from the other Mutable signs that are more flexible and unstable. </p>

				<img src="images/virgo-symbol.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Symbol Meaning</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo's symbol is a virgin or young maiden. Sources attribute the symbol to be a portrayal of Astraea, the Greek virgin goddess of innocence and purity. She was the last of the immortals to leave Earth, hence her association with an Earth sign. This symbol represents Virgo's traits of purity, innocence, and gentleness. Since the symbol is of a virgin maiden, a young girl with no marriage responsibilities, it represents Virgo's selflessness and willingness to help others without losing her independence. </p>
				</div>

				<img src="images/karma4.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Karmic Stage</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo represents the "Adult" stage in the Astrological Karmic Cycle. This is the stage when the soul puts aside all the excitement and fun she was so used to during the Teenager stage of Leo and adopts a very stern and serious manner in order to survive in life. The Virgo soul believes that in order to thrive and prosper in this world, she needs to better herself until she has reached perfection; otherwise she might become obsolete. This is the reason Virgo are so preoccupied in criticizing themselves and others; how else is one going to reach perfection? Virgo's life mantra is "I analyze". They came to teach that "love is purity" and to learn that "love is satisfaction"; Virgo is rarely satisfied with anything/anyone due to their constant criticism. </p>

				<img src="images/eye.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Spot an Virgo</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo usually have a medium to tall height; seldom short. Virgo bodies are usually long, narrow, and thin. No part of their physique, such as their hands and feet, ever seems disproportionately large. Even though the Virgo looks delicate and have delicate features, they are quite strong physically. Virgo's most distinguishing features are their crystal clear eyes; shining with intelligence and clarity of thought.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">Virgo's most distinguishing features are their crystal clear eyes; shining with intelligence and clarity of thought.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p> 
					<p>Another distinguishing feature of Virgo is the unusual distance between their hips and their waist. In social scenes, Virgo is usually the shy, quiet type; examining every moment that passes. They are quite uncomfortable staying in one place not doing anything and have a hard time relaxing completely. They also usually look like they are deeply worried about something; that's because they probably are. </p>
				</div>

			<div class="info-box mid-box">
				<img src="images/strong.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo's strong traits are: clear thinking, strong discernment, politeness, helpfulness, practicality, gentleness, self-righteousness, and a great sense for order and optimization. Since Virgo are ruled by Mercury, they have the ability to understand matters very quickly. Mercury also gives Virgo great communication skills which, when paired with their gentleness and pure charm, can convince even the most stone-walled people of their cause.</p> 
					<p>Virgo are very selfless and are willing to sacrifice a lot of themselves in order to help someone in need without expecting anything in return. Virgo possess a great ability to notice every little detail and have a great memory. It is rare to hear that a Virgo has misplaced something important or has errors in a project he/she has done. Virgo have a very high self-discipline and if they decide to form a habit they will stick to it relentlessly.</p>
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">The short-lasting energy of Mercury causes Virgo to be restless and uncomfortable in a given place if they are not engaged in any work or analysis.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p> 
					<p>Virgo's potential weaknesses are: over-criticism, irritability, shyness, pessimism, low self-esteem, and fallacy. The short-lasting energy of Mercury causes Virgo to be restless and uncomfortable in a given place if they are not engaged in any work or analysis. When this trait is paired up with Virgo's constant worrying, it makes it very difficult for Virgo to relax and let loose. Virgo have a constant fear that they will be sick and therefore have a small pharmacy in their homes and a similar travel kit "if things go wrong". Virgo's extra attention and focus on the little details of an issue or thing makes it difficult for them to see the big picture until they have figured all the little details out. This trait slows their work pace down, not to mention angering others working with them. </p>

				<img src="images/river.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Good Paths in Life vs. Pitfalls</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo's serious manner of life and great sense of responsibility often cause them to spend many hours a day at work and continue thinking and worrying about work after they have left it. This combination of over-work and worry can break down the Virgo's natural good health and cause many physical problems that occur from stress. A good advice would be for Virgo to have a friend or a doctor that would monitor their work habits and health status. Another remedy for this ailment is for Virgo to take up a healthy hobby, one that will help them take their mind off work and worry. Virgo relaxes by doing. Carpentry is usually a great hobby for this meticulous sign that enjoys working with their hands.</p>
					<p>Virgo's need to dissect and analyze all that surrounds them is a very efficient way for them to understand things clearly and optimize them. However, in regards to relationships, this habit can be annoying and hurtful towards others who can easily mistake Virgo's analysis and suggestions as criticism. A good advice would be for Virgo to tell others the true purpose of their analysis; to help them reach perfection. It would be even more efficient and effective of them to ask others' permission before they make their suggestions; some people would like to stay how they are.</p> 
					<p>Due to Virgo's harsh self-criticism and innate humility, they sometimes tend to develop a low self-esteem which they try to over-compensate with arrogance and pompousness. A good advice would be for them to ease up on their self-criticism, and accept and love themselves in order to boost up their self-esteem. </p>

				<img src="images/like.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Likes / Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo enjoy physical exercise, but they don't enjoy direct competition, so team games or games for two are not so popular with this sign. Their favorite sports are ones that involve regular and rhythmical body movement such as walking, hiking, golfing, and Virgo's favorite; bicycling. Other past-times include craftsmanship; Virgo love being busy with their hands and creating useful things. Some of these include areas such carpentry, mechanics, and fixing broken contraptions.</p> 
					<p class="quote"><img src="images/quote-left.svg" alt="" class="quote-left">You can't find a stain on a Virgo's garment; if you do, Virgo would be extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable if you point it out to them.<img src="images/quote-right.svg" alt="" class="quote-right"></p> 
					<p>Virgo is a fussy eater (no surprise there!) and likes to make sure the food they eat is of the highest quality possible. The presentation and cleanliness of their food is also very important. Virgo don't enjoy fatty foods and are often vegetarians or vegans for health reasons. Virgo's clothes are also of the highest quality of material and super clean. You can't find a stain on a Virgo's garment; if you do, Virgo would be extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable if you point it out to them. Virgo like quiet, bright colors for their clothes. The male Virgo particularly loves business suites while the female Virgo likes classic designs; the ones that will never go out of fashion. </p>

				<img src="images/dislike.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Dislikes / Pet Peeves</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Even though Virgo themselves constantly criticizes others (usually not out loud), they really dislike being criticized. The reason for this paradox is that they are so critical of themselves that adding more criticism on top of that is unbearable. Although Virgo is willing to go to great lengths in order to help someone out, they themselves dislike being dependent on the favors of others; they would rather suffer and work hard to get what they want than to get it from someone else.</p> 
					<p>Virgo dislike spending unnecessary money and are known to be penny pincher's. However, when they think they are getting a good deal, Virgo are willing to invest large sums of money. Disorder and dirtiness are a huge pet peeve of a Virgo. They also dislike loud people and scenes and lazy people who do not make an effort to better their own lives. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/deal2.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>How to Approach a Leo</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Although Virgo are very friendly and nice people, they are usually quite shy so you probably will have to approach them yourself before they will ever approach you. Once you have connected with this delicate creature, you will find them to be a very reliable, dependable, competent, and most importantly, selfless friends. Virgo are the kind of friends that you can wake up at any time in the night and ask for a favor that will require of them some sort of sacrifice and they will do it without much fuss.</p> 
					<p>However, this is a sign not to be abused. Despite the selflessness and servitude, Virgo is not the emotionally clinging type at all. They are ready to disconnect ties from any relationship with ease if their analytical minds decide this is the right choice. Virgo are one of the 4 signs in the Zodiac that place mind and reason before emotion (the other 3 are Capricorn, Libra, and Aquarius). As much as Virgo like dispensing criticism, they hates receiving it. They are also blind to seeing their own faults, so pointing them out not only will arouse their anger, but it will also not achieve anything. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="info-box">
				<img src="images/heart.svg" alt="" class="svg-icon"> <h2>Love and Romance</h2>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div class="info-p">
					<p>Virgo always look for quality not quantity. Since they are so critical and picky, finding a mate of their quality caliber can be a rigorous and long process; often going through many of the opposite sex before finding "the one". Both Virgo sexes like the smart, accomplished, quiet, and humble mates. Virgo as mates are very dependable, caring, and not the cheating or jealous type. Although either sexes are not known to very emotional and romantic, they are quite warm and passionate intimately.</p> 
					<p>The male Virgo makes a good husband; usually hard-working, gentle, selfless, and pays close attention to the "little things", a trait that women highly appreciate. However, he might lose his cool if his wife spends "too much" money "unnecessarily". The Virgo female looks for a man who is diligent, hard-working, and well-mannered. Coarseness such as foul language is a big turn-off for her. She also believes that she is better than any man in what she does and rarely admits to being wrong. Her husband would do wisely to take fault to most things gone wrong. </p>

					<p>Virgo's related body parts are the intestines which symbolize Virgo's "digestion" of information. Their lucky color is blue, their lucky stone onyx, their lucky number is 6, their lucky day is Wednesday, and their lucky metal is Mercury. </p>
