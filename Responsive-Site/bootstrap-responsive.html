			<div class="row parag-row">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>Hello, my name is Dr. Steven Gundry, and if you are interested in greatly improving your health, and giving yourself the best possible chance at a long and happy life, I'd like to assure you: you are in the right place.</p>
					<p>I founded Gundry MD with one mission: To allow you to benefit from a new scientific breakthrough that has allowed literally thousands of people to feel healthier and happier than they ever thought possible.</p>
					<p>This includes many who considered themselves, "beyond hope"... or worried they suffered from a problem that could not be fixed.</p>
					<p>Yet, despite the effectiveness of what you are about to discover today, you cannot learn about this in any medical textbook, on any other website. In fact, even most other doctors will readily admit that when it comes to what I'm about to share with you... they don't have a clue.</p>

					<p class="pic-desc">Dr. Gundry's expertise as a heart surgeon led him to new breakthroughs in full-body health treatment.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>For over thirty years, I have been one of the world's pre-eminent experts in heart surgery. My experiences took me all over the world, and to new frontiers of medical science. I was a driving force behind major breakthroughs in medical technology and surgical procedures &ndash; breakthroughs that have revolutionized the way doctors save the lives of patients worldwide.</p>
					<p>But back in 2001, I was asked to treat a chronically ill, overweight patient. This man was considered a hopeless case, someone who couldn't be helped even by surgery. But hopeless cases have been a specialty of mine over the years, and I was willing to take this man's challenge on when no one else would..</p>
					<p>Yet, despite the effectiveness of what you are about to discover today, you cannot learn about this in any medical textbook, on any other website. In fact, even most other doctors will readily admit that when it comes to what I'm about to share with you... they don't have a clue.</p>

			<div class="row parag-row">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>The key to strong, sustainable health lives in all of us... in beneficial "good" microbes in our bodies that are in danger of dying out, thanks to dietary and environmental issues that overload our systems with threatening "bad" microbes. Once you begin taking care of your "good" microbes... or, as I like to call them, "your bugs"... you can be amazed by the changes you see.</p>
					<p>And I know...because it also worked for me.</p>
					<p>When I first met this "lost cause" patient, I was seriously overweight myself.  I had high blood pressure, "bad" cholesterol, all the warning signs for oncoming diabetes and heart disease. I worked out regularly and tried to watch my diet, but I was still struggling with my weight.  But following the principles of my new research, a study I am now calling, "Holobiotics"... I lost 70 pounds in just a year.</p>

				<div class="col-md-4 small-center">
					<img src="img/dr-md.jpg" alt="">
					<p class="pic-desc">Dr. Gundry holds patents on several life-saving medical devices. His new research in the field of "Holobiotics" helps patients get healthy without surgery.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="parag-row">This is why, in 2002, I left my former position at California's Loma Linda University Medical Center, and founded The Center for Restorative Medicine, where I have spent the last 14 years studying the human microbiome &ndash; and developing the principles of Holobiotics that have now changed the lives of countless others.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">My center, based in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara, is devoted to teaching our patients how to live healthier lives through diet and lifestyle choices that will help them avoid the kind of surgeries I performed for over three decades.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">And the rest of the medical world is still catching up.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">I created GundryMD.com to share with you these new discoveries that have taken me over 30 years of working with the toughest cases to figure out.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">Because you see, while I'm able to serve a few hundred patients a year at my medical centers, I know my reach is limited. This is evident by the fact that I now have a 6 month waiting list for those who wish to see me.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">Although I greatly enjoy seeing patients personally, I don't want you to have to wait 6 months, or even one week, to take advantage of these discoveries that for many of my patients have been literally life-changing.</p>
			<p class="parag-row">Welcome to Gundry MD. I'm honored to have you here, and it is my pleasure to guide you towards your healthiest future.</p>

			<div class="row parag-row">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>If you're curious about Gundry MD Holobiotics supplements and health products, you're probably asking one question before all the others...</p>
					<h4 class="">WHAT IS HOLOBIOTICS?</h4>
					<p>It's the concept that guides Dr. Gundry's "Diet Evolution" system, and all the supplements and products he's designed to support it. It's based on the belief that true health only happens when you're living in a state of cooperation with the trillions of tiny microbes that live everywhere in, on, and around your body.</p>
					<p>Think of your body like an apartment complex. You're the landlord, and these trillions of tiny bugs are your tenants. Some of those bugs are "good" tenants, managing your digestion, helping energy move throughout your body, and powering as much as 80 percent of your immune system function, to keep you from getting sick or infected. But your body is also home to "bad" tenants...lectins (plant-based proteins that harm proper cell function), pathogens (bugs that cause illness and infection), and gut yeasts (which harm healthy digestion and help make you overweight).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 small-center">
					<img src="img/body.jpg" alt="">
					<p class="pic-desc">HOLOBIOTICS:  Your body and its "bugs" working together to give you optimum health</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row parag-row">
				<div class="col-md-4 small-center">
					<img src="img/shugar.jpg" alt="">
					<p class="pic-desc">Sugar and other sweeteners endanger your "good" bugs and keep you from feeling your best</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>Naturally, you don't want these "bad" bugs running the show. But when you feed them unhealthy foods like sugars, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives, this makes them stronger, helps them kill off the "good" bugs...and turns your body into the kind of "building" where only bad bugs would want to live.</p>
					<p>To restore your body to optimum health and wellness, you need to be sure you're taking care of the "good" bugs, making them stronger and better able to do their jobs promoting a strong and healthy you. Every product from Gundry MD Holobiotics is designed with this purpose in mind...whether it's a nutritional supplement for keeping the bugs in your gut powerfully effective...a skin treatment to nourish the healthy bacteria that live on the outside of your body...or any of the exciting new products currently in the works in the Gundry MD labs.</p>
					<p>That's holobiotics. It's all about taking care of your good bacteria. Because if you take care of them... they'll take care of you.</p>
