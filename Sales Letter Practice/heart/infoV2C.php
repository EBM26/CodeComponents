			<p>[Please keep reading. The information I have for you is very important… possibly life-changing.]</p>
			<p>My name is Dr. Arash Bereliani. I’m a board certified cardiologist, and the woman – let’s call her Karen – was a new patient. Now, some doctors might have told her not to worry. Some might even have told her not to be so overly dramatic.</p>

				<p class="caption">“The Quiet Assassin” will turn your heart into a ticking time bomb.</p>
			</div>
			<p>But I did not.</p>
			<p>Because the danger is real. The threat is deadly.</p>
			<p>So her desperate cry for help was entirely justified. You see, Karen – like so many other people – was locked in a life and death struggle with a deadly condition I call “The Quiet Assassin.”</p>
			<p>I call it that because this condition can creep up silently and strike without notice.</p>
			<p>And it can have a devastating effect on you, your health… even your life.</p>
			<p>You see, if The Quiet Assassin is stalking you, you could be at high risk of sudden death in the next decade… and not even know it.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>The Quiet Assassin, known to medical professionals as <i>hyperlipidemia</i>, can cause your arteries to fill up with sludge…</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>And eventually, your heart becomes a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment…and take you with it.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>How serious is the threat? Over 800,000 people in the U.S. die from cardiovascular disease <i><u>every year</u></i>.<sup>3</sup></p>
			<p>That’s more than 90 people cut down before their time… EACH AND EVERY HOUR.<sup>4</sup></p>
			<p>The Quiet Assassin does not rest. It is relentless. And with every tick of the clock, time runs out for a chosen few of your fellow citizens. And here’s the most disturbing news of all…</p>
			<p>The Quiet Assassin could already be at work inside you.</p>
			<p class="bold">If you’re experiencing any of the following symptoms:</p>

			</div>
			<p>They may be warning signs that the Quiet Assassin is already at work inside your body…  wreaking havoc on your heart health...</p>
			<p class="bold">But this does NOT have to be your fate!</p>
			<p>If you experienced any of these warning signs – or even if you haven’t noticed them yet – I urge you to read this report closely.</p>
			<p>Because there is hope.</p>
			<p>Thanks to a revolutionary breakthrough, a small group of doctors in California have developed a way for you to escape the ravages of hyperlipidemia. And with the help of this breakthrough…</p>

			<p>I’m extremely pleased – and excited – that I can share these methods with you. Please read the entire report. It contains cutting-edge information that could change your life forever.</p>
			<p>Before I dive into the groundbreaking details, let me tell you more about myself, and why this is so important to me.</p>
			<p>Again, my name is Dr. Bereliani, and I'm the Head of Research at Princeton Nutrients.</p>
			<p>I'm a Board Certified Physician, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology, and an active member of the American Heart Association</p>
			<p>And today, I’m about to blow the lid off The Quiet Assassin... and show you how you can protect your heart and improve your overall health, quickly and easily.</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>But first, I’m going to expose the <b><u>Three Leading “Cardiac Threats”</u></b>… so you can fight back against hyperlipidemia, starting today.</p>
			<img src="images/divider.jpg" class="divider">
			<h1>
				Cardiac Threat #1:<br>
				Processed Foods and Sugar
			</h1>
			<div class="right ml40">
				<img src="images/sweets.jpg">
				<p class="caption">Almost all processed food contains lots of sugar, not just cookies and candy.</p>
			</div>
			<p>200 years ago, the average person consumed 2 pounds of sugar per year.</p>
			<p>But today, in 2016, the average American eats <i>66 pounds</i> of sugar a year!</p>
			<p>And if you’re overweight, you might be consuming <u>as much as 150 pounds of sugar every single year</u>.</p>
			<p><b>But, this is NOT your fault</b>...a quick check at the grocery store reveals that the major food companies are LOADING almost everything we eat with sugar.</p>
			<p>And this is incredibly dangerous. Because research links excess sugar to <b>high cholesterol and high triglyceride</b> levels… both components of hyperlipidemia… and serious heart problems.</p>
			<p>And here’s something else…</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>It turns out, excess sugar can also elevate your levels of something called <b>C-reactive protein</b>, which is a marker of bodily inflammation.</p>
			<p>Now, most people are familiar with inflammation. Inflammation is a response your body has to damage.</p>
			<p>For instance, when you jam your toe, it turns red, swells, and you feel pain. This is “inflammation” – your body’s way of repairing the damage. It’s actually one of your body’s main ways of healing itself.</p>
			<p>So inflammation is designed to help you...when it is working properly. But for many people, <i><u>inflammation is going out of control</u></i>.</p>
			<p>For instance, people who have arthritis experience constant inflammation in their joints. Redness, swelling, pain – this is OUT OF CONTROL INFLAMMATION, and means your body is not working right.</p>
			<p>Your body is literally attacking itself… It’s like your body has flipped on a Self-Destruct Switch.</p>
			<p>And unless you have access to farm-fresh foods every day, you’re probably eating too much sugar… leading to <b>hyperlipidemia <i>and</i> inflammation in your body</b>.<sup>8</sup></p>
			<h1>
				Cardiac Threat #2:<br>
				Stress
			</h1>
			<p>There is now clear evidence linking stress to hyperlipidemia.</p>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>A recent study showed that stress can lead to <u>poor eating habits</u> and higher <u>body weight</u>... both of which are <i>risk factors</i> for hyperlipidemia... and <i>serious</i> heart problems.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="left mr40">
				<img src="images/stress.jpg">
				<p class="caption">Everyday stress sends cortisol flooding through your body… leading to inflammation.</p>
			</div>
			<p>And stress doesn’t just increase your chances of developing hyperlipidemia... When you’re under stress, your body releases a chemical known as cortisol.</p>
			<p>Cortisol triggers your “fight or flight” reaction… pumping adrenaline into your muscles, getting you ready to face physical danger.</p>
			<p>The cause could be an overbearing boss…...someone cutting you off on the freeway… or even a financial problem you’re facing.</p>
			<p>But when your body doesn’t use the “fight or flight” chemicals, by physically fighting or running away, they just sit there in your muscles...</p>
			<p>Making you feel anxious, jittery, and upset.</p>
			<p>A landmark study at Carnegie Mellon University — one of the premier universities in America — showed that…</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>Stress not only leads to inflammation... <b>it can actually make you sick</b>.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Researchers subjected 279 healthy adults to a virus, and then tracked them for 5 days. The ones that reported experiencing prolonged stress were <b>SIGNIFICANTLY</b> more likely to develop a cold.<sup>9</sup></p>
			<p>According lead researcher Dr. Sheldon Cohen, inflammation is the root cause:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">When under stress, cells of the immune system are unable to respond to hormonal control, and consequently, produce levels of inflammation that promote disease.<br><br>Because inflammation plays a role in many diseases such as cardiovascular, asthma and autoimmune disorders, this model suggests why stress impacts them as well.</p>
				<p class="author">- Dr. Sheldon Cohen</p>
				<p class="authorSub">Carnegie Mellon University <sup>5</sup></p>
			</div>
			<p>So if you’ve experienced chronic stress, the resulting inflammation may be doing serious damage to your body.</p>
			<p>But the third culprit might be the worst of all…</p>
			<h1>
				Cardiac Threat #3:<br>
				Sedentary Lifestyle
			</h1>
			<div class="right ml40">
				<img src="images/cave.jpg">
				<p class="caption">The human body is designed for physical activity. Our sedentary lifestyle takes a toll on our health.</p>
			</div>
			<p>In the past, physical activity was something people did every day… Our ancestors spent many of their waking hours hunting, farming, and gathering food.</p>
			<p>But in the modern world, sedentary lifestyles are the norm… and our bodies are paying the price.</p>
			<p>Sure, we try to squeeze in some exercise sessions during week, but the truth is most of us simply aren’t doing enough.</p>
			<p>According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, regular exercise boosts heart health by raising your “good” cholesterol and lowering triglycerides.</p>
			<p>But when we don’t exercise, we give hyperlipidemia the space it needs to set in and start building up inside our arteries.</p>
			<p>And lack of exercise is doing something else to hurt our health… it’s making us fat!</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>According to the National Institute of Health,<br>an astounding <b><u>68% of Americans are now overweight</u></b>.</p>
			</div>
			<p>These extra pounds are not just an appearance issue. A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found there is a direct correlation between gaining weight...and <b>C-RP</b>, the #1 biomarker for inflammation I mentioned earlier:</p>
			<p>Just look at these results:</p>
			<div class="purpOutline">
				<ul class="checksJPG">
					<li>Among “Normal Weight” individuals, 25% had elevated C-RPhad elevated C-RP</li>
					<li>Among “Overweight” individuals, 51% had elevated C-RP</li>
					<li>And among “Obese” individuals, a staggering 75% had high C-RP</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="left mr40">
				<img src="images/skeleton.jpg">
				<p class="caption">A study at Johns Hopkins University proved there is a direct link between weight gain and inflammation.</p>
			</div>
			<p>And if you’ve gained any extra weight recently, you’ve probably felt the inflammation first-hand...most commonly in the lower back, pelvis, knees and feet.</p>
			<p>If you’ve felt pain in any of these areas, that is your body screaming at you: <b>“Help</b>.”</p>
			<p>I see people struggling with these problems <u>every day</u>. Unfortunately, the solutions just <i>aren’t convenient for many people</i>...</p>
			<p>Unless you live on a farm, it’s tough to eliminate <b>all</b> processed foods and sugars.</p>
			<p>And only professional athletes can exercise rigorously <u>every single day</u>.</p>
			<p>As for stress? Well, that might be <u>the most difficult to control of all</u>. But as a doctor, just realizing this was not enough.</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>I wanted to actually be able to offer my patients a way out of this “self-destruct” spiral that so many people’s bodies are stuck in.</p>
			<p>So several years ago, I began to dedicate a large portion of my career to finding a solution. I spent many long nights poring over research, looking for a starting point.</p>
			<p>All my research kept pointing me to <b>one culprit</b>:</p>
			<img src="images/divider.jpg" class="divider">
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="sectionTwo">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>C-Reactive Protein, or C-RP</h1>
			<p>C-RP is a protein released by your liver, that doctors use to test for inflammation in the body.</p>
			<p>C-RP first caught my attention in 1997, when Dr. Paul Ridker of Harvard Medical School began finding a relationship between this nasty protein and heart disease. Dr. Ridker discovered that…</p>
			<p>A C-RP reading of 3.0 mg/L or higher <b><u>can triple your risk of heart disease</u></b>. The danger seems <u>even greater in women</u> than in men.</p>
			<p>The flip side is also true: Folks with extremely low levels of C-RP, <u>rarely have heart attacks</u>.</p>
			<p>Then, in 2004, researchers at Remin Hospital made a startling discovery…</p>
			<p>After much testing, they discovered that C-RP isn’t just a <b>“sign”</b> of inflammation...</p>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>They concluded C-RP may actually be a<br><b>DIRECT CAUSE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</b>.<sup>10</sup></p>
			</div>
			<div class="left mr40">
				<img src="images/xray.jpg">
				<p class="caption">If we can reduce levels of C-RP, there could be incredible health benefits… for your entire body.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Based on this study and many others, I began to see C-RP for what it really is — a danger to your entire health, starting with the most important organ in your body: Your heart.</p>
			<p>My mission had become clear: <b>CRP MUST BE STOPPED</b>.</p>
			<p>But I quickly realized that NOBODY in the medical field wanted to address this issue...not the insurance companies, not the device manufacturers, and certainly not the drug makers.</p>
			<p>After all, these people make <i>billions</i> of dollars off their lucrative products, which treat all the symptoms of CRP one-by-one.</p>
			<p>That’s when my partners and I realized we would have to go it alone...and not only that, we would need to work around the drug companies and the billionaires who control “Big Pharma.”</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>So I asked myself:</p>
			<p class="fs20 bold">Could we create our own C-RP lowering formula that people could take in the comfort of their own home?</p>
			<div class="right ml40">
				<img src="images/scientist.jpg">
				<p class="caption">After months of researching how to lower C-RP…we finally had a major breakthrough</p>
			</div>
			<p>I can tell you, our initial efforts yielded some good results, but nothing lowered C-RP levels like we wanted to. Our “dream result” was a formula that lowered C-RP in the 30-40% range.</p>
			<p>Yet all our efforts came up short. They were very trying times, and I sometimes questioned if this problem had an answer...or at least one that we’d discover in my lifetime.</p>
			<p>And then, we finally had a breakthrough.</p>
			<p>A colleague of mine — who worked on digestive health, of all things — turned me on to a fascinating new field of study.</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>He had done research that showed the best way to fight C-RP may actually start somewhere nobody expected: <b>Your gut</b>.</p>
			</div>
			<p>You see, the beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract – called “probiotics” – have long been used to treat digestive issues.</p>
			<p>I’d known for years that certain probiotics were very effective at treating things like gas, bloating, and diarrhea...but had <b>never heard</b> of a probiotic that affected C-RP.</p>
			<p>But this colleague was involved in a whole new type of research – called “<b>Targeted Probiotics</b>” – that involved creating NEW types of powerful probiotics...</p>
			<div class="left mr40">
				<img src="images/bacteria.jpg">
				<p class="caption">We discovered a probiotic “targeted” to help promote heart health, boost energy, and reduce aches and pains…from INSIDE your gut.</p>
			</div>
			<p>...some of which could treat other health issues <b>ALL OVER</b> the body.</p>
			<p>Well, it turned out some of these targeted probiotics might affect certain hormones...including C-RP.</p>
			<p>Once we realized this, a whole new world opened up for our research. I felt like a ray of light had shined down, finally pointing me toward a solution.</p>
			<p>We tested dozens of probiotic strains...some worked well, but we knew we needed to go farther.</p>
			<p>Eventually, we discovered a very unique strain:</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<h1>Lactobacillus Reuteri</h1>
			<p>This “targeted strain” focused on one area more than any other: Heart Health</p>
			<p>In fact, after testing it, we soon started calling L. reuteri the “Heart Hero” probiotic…</p>
			<p>Here’s why...</p>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>In one study, mice were given L. reuteri. They experienced a 38%<br>reduction in total cholesterol… <b>IN JUST 7 DAYS</b>.<sup>11</sup></p>
				<p>Supplementation also <u>reduced blood triglycerides by 40%</u> and raised the<br> ratio of beneficial HDL to LDL cholesterol by 20%.<sup>12</sup></p>
				<p>L. reuteri even <b>PREVENTED</b> the cholesterol damage of a high fat diet.<sup>13</sup></p>
				<p>In addition, the mice fed L. reuteri <b><u>gained SIGNIFICANTLY LESS<br> WEIGHT</u></b> than the mice who took a placebo!<sup>14</sup></p>
			</div>
			<div class="right ml40">
				<img src="images/pills.jpg">
				<p class="caption">When L. reuteri was given to humans, it turned out to be one of the most powerful “targeted probiotics” we had ever tested.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Based on these results, it was time to start testing on humans.</p>
			<p>A double blind, placebo controlled study was conducted on healthy adults…the gold standard in clinical research. This study was conducted at the world renowned Biomedical Technology and Cell Therapy Research Laboratory at McGill University, to ensure the results would be beyond doubt.</p>
			<p>This is where things really got incredible.</p>
			<p>After users took L. reuteri in capsule form for nine weeks:</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<ul class="checksJPG ml0">
				<li>LDL cholesterol fell by nearly 12%.<sup>15</sup></li>
				<li>Total cholesterol fell by 9%.<sup>16</sup></li>
				<li>Non-HDL cholesterol fell by 11%.<sup>17</sup></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With a reduction in the LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio of 13%.<sup>18</sup></p>
			<p>But the result on C-RP was truly shocking…</p>
			<div class="purpOutline">
				<p class="bold">L. reuteri reduced C-RP by an astonishing 62% compared to placebo!<sup>19</sup></p>
			</div>
			<p>We had not only achieved the goal we’d set for ourselves...we had surpassed it!</p>
			<p>My partners and I were <u>ecstatic</u>.</p>
			<div class="left mr40">
				<img src="images/people.jpg">
				<p class="caption">The results of this powerful formula were so incredible, I was determined to make it  available to everyone.</p>
			</div>
			<p>I immediately obtained a batch of pure L. Reuteri. We chose a powerful, patented strain not found anywhere else.</p>
			<p>I began offering it to my patients and, as I had hoped, the results were fantastic.</p>
			<p>I was overjoyed...we had finally found a way to battle C-RP and give people the healthier, happier life they deserved.</p>
			<p>There was only one thing left to do with this groundbreaking new compound: give it a name.</p>
			<p>We called it...</p>

			<h1>Heart Biotics</h1>
			<p>Heart Biotics is the first and only compound made of pure, patented L. reuteri which is proven to reduce C-RP by <b>62% compared to placebo</b>!</p>
			<p>But that’s not all. The ingredients in Heart Biotics have been shown to:</p>
			<div class="productBackground">
				<ul class="checksJPG ml0">
					<li>Support Healthy Cholesterol</li>
					<li>Support healthy C-RP levels</li>
					<li>Boost energy</li>

				<p>Our users have even reported:</p>
				<ul class="checksJPG ml0">
					<li>Clearer, softer skin</li>
					<li>Fewer allergies</li>
					<li>Less aches and pains</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>If you’ve ever struggled with common symptoms like:</p>

			<ul class="redChecksJPG ml0">
				<li>Low energy</li>

			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>Or any of the other common symptoms that indicate your body is fighting you at every turn...</p>
			<p>Then Heart Biotics was designed for you.</p>
			<p>What makes Heart Biotics so revolutionary is that this product is specially created to fight C-RP using the power of <u>targeted probiotics</u>.</p>
			<div class="purpOutline center">
				<p>Using this high-tech, patented probiotic strain to make people healthier is a true breakthrough...and the clinical results <b>show it works</b>.</p>
			</div>
			<p>But I know these numbers don’t always tell the full story...they don’t show what it actually feels like to finally deactivate your “self-destruct” switch and restore your health to the levels you were meant to enjoy.</p>
			<p>That’s why I asked some of my early users to take Heart Biotics for 2 weeks, and tell me if they felt any different.</p>
			<p>Well, I’ll let you hear what they experienced, in their own words:</p>
			<p>Linda R. from Reno, NV said:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">I keep feeling a little better more &amp; more...main thing I am seeing a genuine difference in my digestive system &amp; that alone is a real help. I have noticed a surge of more energy, therefore I find myself being more tidy with things around the house; you know pick up &amp; put away kind a thing... &amp; that alone makes you feel better because you are getting something accomplished. When your body is sick that does not happen....</p>
				<p class="author">- by Linda R.</p>
				<p class="authorSub">from Reno, NV</p>
			</div>
			<p>And Karen S. from Apollo, PA told me this:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">I am getting more things done at home, even after working all day. My skin appears smoother and my skin tone more evenly balanced.</p>
				<p class="author">- by Karen S.</p>
				<p class="authorSub">from Apollo, PA</p>
			</div>
			<p>And Virgil R. from Shreveport, LA might have said it best:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">I have more energy and I have added to my workouts. Some positive changes have been weight loss, less bloated, less digestive discomfort, feeling more productive, feeling more confident in myself and physical and mental energy.</p>
				<p class="author">- by Virgil R.</p>
				<p class="authorSub">from Shreveport, LA</p>
			</div>
			<p>When I read these comments — and when I see the changes, first hand, in people’s faces when they begin using Heart Biotics...I know that all our years of <b>research</b> and <b><u>hard work was worth it</u></b>.</p>
			<p>And using Heart Biotics couldn’t be simpler. Here’s how it works:</p>
			<ul class="checksJPG ml0 bold">
				<li>Heart Biotics comes in a small, easy to swallow capsule.</li>
				<li>You just take one capsule, twice a day.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="right ml40">
				<img src="images/heart.jpg">
				<p class="caption">Heart Biotics re-colonizes your digestive tract, driving out bad bacteria, and boosting your digestive and heart health.</p>
			</div>
			<p>You can take Heart Biotics with any type of food or beverage — in fact, this strain has been proven in multiple studies to successfully survive digestion...unlike some probiotics, which are not strong enough and get destroyed by your stomach acids.</p>
			<p>Once Heart Biotics is in your stomach, it immediately goes to work.</p>
			<p>The L. reuteri probiotics will begin what I call “<i>recolonizing</i>” your digestive tract. That means these helpful probiotics will spread in your digestive tract, like an army fighting for your health.</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>Even better, as the good probiotics spread, they begin to drive out all the “bad bacteria” that are currently living in your gut. These harmful bacteria can sap you of your strength and cause sickness, digestive issues, and fatigue.</p>
			<p>As your new, friendly army takes over and clears out the bad guys, you’ll begin to feel the health and energy boost you need.</p>
			<p>One of the questions I get asked most often about Heart Biotics is:</p>

				<p>I can tell you that some users begin feeling changes<br>in their body in as little as a few days.</p>

			<p>But I always recommend that my patients take Heart Biotics for <u>at least 4 weeks</u> so they can start to see the <u>deeper benefits</u>.</p>
			<p>And I can personally attest to these deeper benefits — because I am a daily Heart Biotics user.</p>

			<p>My friends commented that my skin looked <b>smoother</b> and <b>younger</b>. I was surprised...people could actually see the changes I was feeling every day.</p>
			<p>Best of all was the long-awaited reduction of all those aches, pains, creaky joints and sore muscles I’d dealt with for years…</p>
			<p>It wasn’t just that I’d “stopped” the self-destruct switch...I felt like I was actually turning back the clock on my body.</p>
			<p class="bold fs20">I felt stronger and healthier than I had in years...or maybe ever.</p>

				<p class="caption">Many research institutes and universities, including Harvard Medical School, have warned about the dangers of C-RP.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Even as a doctor, <u>these results shocked me</u>.</p>
			<p>Now, let me be very clear:</p>
			<p>While the effects of L. reuteri have been studied for years now, the discovery of how it affects C-RP and cholesterol levels is very recent.</p>
			<p>As such, there is no conclusive evidence, as of now, that lowering C-RP can prevent, treat, or cure any type of disease whatsoever.</p>
			<p>It's simply too soon to know.</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>In fact, by Federal law, no vitamin or supplement can claim to treat or prevent any disease or illness. And I am making no such claim.</p>
			<p>That being said, Harvard Medical School, the top medical research institution in the world, recently stated:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">A gush of studies has shown that as the C-RP level rises, so does the risk of having — or dying from — a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular problem. <sup>20</sup></p>
				<p class="author mbi">- Harvard Medical School, 2005</p>
			</div>
			<p>And according to esteemed biologist Chris Woolston, M.S.:</p>
			<div class="purpBackground">
				<p class="quote">When tissues become inflamed, they release several different proteins, including C-RP. If a heart attack or stroke is looming in your future, <u>now is the time to act</u>. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working with your doctor, you can protect your heart — and <u>perhaps save your life</u>.</p>

			<p>Just think…as recently as 10 years ago, researchers barely understood what targeted probiotics were and how they functioned.</p>
			<p>And for the past several years, the benefits of targeted probiotics could only be experienced by scientists in labs like Yale and UCLA, with access to multi-million dollar machines.</p>
			<p>Yet today – right now -- regular people like you and I have access to one of the most incredible medical discoveries in human history!</p>
			<img src="images/divider.jpg" class="divider">
			<h1>We are truly blessed.</h1>
			<p>And when I tell you that, I’m not just speaking as a doctor. I’m speaking from experience as a patient…because I also use Heart Biotics.</p>

				<p>I’m 48 years old. And while some guys my age are slowing down,<br>I’m literally in the best shape of my life.<br>I lift more than I did when I was in college.</p>
			</div>
			<p>I have more energy than I did twenty years ago. When I’m at work, I feel alert and clear-headed all day. All those little aches and pains I used to deal with are now gone.</p>
			<p>For the first time in my life,</p>
			<ul class="checksJPG ml0 bold">
				<li>I find it effortless to eat small portions, without feeling hungry all day.</li>
				<li>I feel good after I eat...bloating and digestive issues are a thing of the past.</li>
				<li>I eat what I want, and when I look down, I don’t see any belly.</li>
				<li>I love knowing my weight and my health are now under my control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>My body just feels like it’s working. And best of all, I have the energy and the motivation to spend my free time with my loved ones. It means the world to me that I can...</p>
			<ul class="checksJPG ml0 bold">
				<li>Go on hikes</li>
				<li>Play sports</li>

			<p>When we are at the capacity to sell in stores, Heart Biotics will retail for $89.95 for a 30-Day supply.</p>

			<p>However</p>

			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p>You’ve probably got questions, which is very common. In fact, here’s a few of the things my patients ask me most often about Heart Biotics:</p>
			<p><b>How many bottles should I order?</b><br>The average order for new customers is 3 bottles and that’s what we recommend to start.</p>
			<p>However, because we have many repeat customers, we offer the 6 bottle package so you can take advantage of our best pricing.</p>
			<p><b>What's in Heart Biotics?</b><br>Heart Biotics is made with pure Lactobacillus reuteri...a patented strain known as <b>L. reuteri 30242</b>.</p>
			<p>Each capsule contains 2.9 billion CFUs, or “<i>colony forming units</i>.”</p>
			<p>Once ingested, these powerful probiotics will go to work recolonizing your gut. They not only target specific heart health biomarkers but also activate a host of benefits for your body and your overall health.</p>
			<p><b>How safe is Heart Biotics? Are there any side effects?</b><br>Heart Biotics is a formulation of <b>all-natural ingredients</b>. There is nothing artificial or synthetic or man-made, and there’s no known side-effects. Plus, we source <b><u>only the purest form L. reuteri that goes into every single capsule</u></b>.</p>
			<p>Some users report a surge of energy that seems to last throughout the day, however, that is <i>perfectly</i> natural.</p>
			<p><b>How should I take Heart Biotics?</b><br>We recommend you take 2 capsules a day. To help you stay consistent, we recommend making it a habit of taking Heart Biotics first thing in the morning. It is okay to take on an empty stomach. Our capsules are small and very easy to swallow. You do not need to refrigerate them.</p>
			<p><b>How long does it take to work?</b><br>Everyone's body is different, and everyone has a different amount of C-RP when they begin taking Heart Biotics. For that reason, it is very difficult to predict exactly when you will begin feeling results. I can tell you that many people feel a difference in their energy levels in just the first few days.</p>
			<p>However, I usually suggest waiting 30 days for your digestive tract to be recolonized to a point where you can begin seeing and feeling a difference in your body.</p>
			<p><b>What if it doesn't work for me? Is there a guarantee?</b><br>We take your health seriously... which is why we've sourced only the <b>purest</b> and <b>most potent</b> form of L. reuteri that goes into Heart Biotics.</p>
			<p>In the unlikely event that you don't experience a near-immediate improvement in your health, and the health and vitality of your entire body, we do offer you a 90 day no questions asked money back guarantee.</p>
			<p><i>And the last question: </i><b>Can I buy Heart Biotics in stores?</b><br>The answer to this one is no. We deliver Heart Biotics straight to you, the consumer, cutting out the middle man <b>so you save money</b>. And now, with our <b>special new customer offer</b>, you can get Heart Biotics at the <b>lowest possible price</b>. Best of all, when you get Heart Biotics through this offer, you'll be “grandfathered in” at this price, even if we have to raise costs in the future.</p>
			<p>So what are you waiting for? Click on the button below, and place your order now. And let me be the first to welcome you to the Heart Biotics family, and congratulate you on this wise decision to invest in your new, healthier life.</p>
