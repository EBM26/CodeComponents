	    				<h1 class="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	    				<p class="questions">How many bottles should I order?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">The average order for new customers is 3 bottles and that’s what we recommend to start. </p>
	    				<p class="answers">However, because we have many repeat customers, we offer the 6 bottle package so you can take advantage of our best pricing.</p>
	    				<p class="questions">What's in Vital Biotics?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Vital Biotics is made with pure <span class="italic">Lactobacillus reuteri</span>...a patented strain known as <span class="bold">L. reuteri 30242</span>.</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Each capsule contains 2.9 billion CFUs, or “<span class="italic">colony forming units</span>.”</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Once ingested, these powerful probiotics will go to work recolonizing your gut. They not only target specific heart health biomarkers but also activate a host of benefits for your body and your overall health.</p>
	    				<p class="questions">How safe is Vital Biotics? Are there any side effects?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Vital Biotics is a formulation of <span class="bold">all-natural ingredients</span>. There is nothing artificial or synthetic or man-made, and there’s no known side-effects. Plus, we source <span class="bold underline">only the purest form L. reuteri that goes into every single capsule.</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Some users report a surge of energy that seems to last throughout the day, however, that is <span class="italic">perfectly</span> natural.</p>
	    				<p class="questions">How should I take Vital Biotics?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">We recommend you take 2 capsules a day. To help you stay consistent, we recommend making it a habit of taking Vital Biotics first thing in the morning. It is okay to take on an empty stomach. Our capsules are small and very easy to swallow. You do not need to refrigerate them.</p>
	    				<p class="questions">How long does it take to work?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">Everyone's body is different, and everyone has a different amount of C-RP when they begin taking Vital Biotics. For that reason, it is very difficult to predict exactly when you will begin feeling results. I can tell you that many people feel a difference in their energy levels in just the first few days.</p>
	    				<p class="answers">However, I usually suggest waiting 30 days for your digestive tract to be recolonized to a point where you can begin seeing and feeling a difference in your body.</p>
	    				<p class="questions">What if it doesn't work for me? Is there a guarantee?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">We take your health seriously... which is why we've sourced only the <span class="bold">purest</span> and <span class="bold">most potent</span> form of L. reuteri that goes into Vital Biotics.</p>
	    				<p class="answers">In the unlikely event that you don't experience a near-immediate improvement in your health, and the health and vitality of your entire body, we do offer you a 90 day no questions asked money back guarantee.</p>
	    				<p class="questions"><span class="fontsmaller">And the last question:</span> Can I buy Vital Biotics in stores?</p>
	    				<p class="answers">The answer to this one is no. We deliver Vital Biotics straight to you, the consumer, cutting out the middle man <span class="bold">so you save money</span>. And now, with our <span class="bold">special new customer offer</span>, you can get Vital Biotics at the <span class="bold">lowest possible price</span>. Best of all, when you get Vital Biotics through this offer, you'll be “grandfathered in” at this price, even if we have to raise costs in the future.</p>
	    				<p class="answers">So what are you waiting for? Click on the button below, and place your order now. And let me be the first to welcome you to the Vital Biotics family, and congratulate you on this wise decision to invest in your new, healthier life.</p>
